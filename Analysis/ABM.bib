The purpose of this Feature is to examine critically and contribute to the burgeoning multi-disciplinary literature on markets as complex adaptive systems (CAS). The new sciences of complexity, the principles of self-organisation and emergence along with the methods of evolutionary computation and artificially intelligent agent models have been developed in a multi-disciplinary fashion. The cognoscenti here consider that complex systems whether natural or artificial, physical, biological or socio-economic can be characterised by a unifying set of principles. Further, it is held that these principles mark a paradigm shift from earlier ways of viewing such phenomenon.},

Theories of self-organization are now being used by post-Darwinian evolutionary theorists, and they provide a promising alternative to the traditional view that social change arises primarily through external conflict and selection.},

The empirical side of economic complexity may be divided into three general branches: historical studies, the identification of power and scaling laws, and analyses of social interactions. I argue that, while providing useful 'stylised facts', none of these empirical approaches has produced compelling evidence that economic contexts exhibit the substantive microstructure or properties of complex systems. This failure reflects inadequate attention to identification problems. Identification analysis should therefore be at the centre of future work on the empirics of complexity.},

Alongside increasing returns, network externalities, and information cascades, information contagion has been presented in the literature as an explanation for particular patterns of macrobehavior that may seem at odds with the underlying micromotives. Whereas these other explanations have been shown to have a proper microfoundation, information contagion has remained a phenomenon that seemed to occur only when certain ad hoc rules of thumb for individual behavior are assumed. I show how information-contagious behavior can emerge in a coevolutionary process of interacting adaptive agents, how this is related to various Hayekian themes, and how ACE research in general can be seen as an application of Hayek's methodological insights.},

Second, market outcomes depend on strategic interactions in which power in the political sense is exercised. It follows that economics must become more behavioral and more institutional.

In much (but not all) of their formal mathematical modeling, maximization and equilibrium are taken literally. Ordinarily, however, both maximization and equilibrium are interpreted as tendencies in the verbal articulation. Such a "tendency" theory, which is thought by many economists to be closer to reality, is believed to be intrinsically difficult to formalize in such a way as to obtain verifiable theorems-for example, that a shift in the ratio of factor prices will induce the industry to change factor proportions in the opposite direction. This paper offers a more optimistic view of the prospects for formalizing this tendency approach. A formal evolutionary model is presented in which essentially neoclassical conclusions regarding the effect of factor prices on factor ratios are deduced without any recourse to concepts either of maximization or industry equilibrium.},

  abstract = {The core of this work is the definition of an agent-based model for a simple Luhmann economy based on publications of Niklas Luhmann. Using an implementation on a default personal computer the behaviour of the model is studied when assumptions regarding initial conditions are made. Fuzzy-c-means clustering is used as visualisation aid. The impact of the observation horizon (a model parameter determining how far agents can see) is studied interactively. Solution paths of the Luhmann economy originating from an initial endowment to equilibrium (when the economy settles down) are studied. The impact of model parameters determining the unevenness regarding the initial distribution of wealth is studied by Monte Carlo simulation. Niklas Luhmann's hypothesis, that the economy starts from and produces further inequality in order to continue (see Luhmann 1988, p. 112) could be reproduced by computer simulation. The main characteristic of the approach is the consideration of the cohesive structure of communication (i.e. one communicative act - many understanding observers) also prominent in Dunbar (1996, pp. 192-207). The model gives directions how to model further aspects of Niklas Luhmann's theory.},

  abstract = {Monetary incentives, such as subsidies or bonuses, are often considered as a way to foster contributions to public goods in society and firms. This paper investigates experimentally the effect of private contribution incentives in the presence of a norm enforcement mechanism. Norm enforcement through peer punishment has been shown to be effective in raising contributions by itself. We test whether and how (centrally provided) private incentives interact with (decentralized) punishment, both of which affect subjects' monetary payoffs. The results of our experiment show that private incentives for contributors can reduce the effectiveness of the norm enforcement mechanism: Free riders are punished less harshly in the treatment with incentives, and as a consequence, average contributions to the public good are no higher than without incentives. This finding ties to and extends previous research on settings in which monetary incentives may fail to have the desired effect.},

This is especially troublesome for projects that require specialization. Rather than using toolkits that are the most publicized but are designed for general projects, using this paper, one will be able to choose a toolkit that already exists and that may be built especially for one's particular domain and specialized needs. In this paper, we examine the entire continuum of agent based toolkits. We characterize each based on 5 important characteristics users consider when choosing a toolkit, and then we categorize the characteristics into user-friendly taxonomies that aid in rapid indexing and easy reference.},

Although organization scientists have studied complex organizations for many years, a developing set of conceptual and computational tools makes possible new approaches to modeling nonlinear interactions within and between organizations. Complex adaptive system models represent a genuinely new way of simplifying the complex. They are characterized by four key elements: agents with schemata, self-organizing networks sustained by importing energy, coevolution to the edge of chaos, and system evolution based on recombination. New types of models that incorporate these elements will push organization science forward by merging empirical observation with computational agent-based simulation. Applying complex adaptive systems models to strategic management leads to an emphasis on building systems that can rapidly evolve effective adaptive solutions. Strategic direction of complex organizations consists of establishing and modifying environments within which effective, improvised, self-organized solutions can evolve. Managers influence strategic behavior by altering the fitness landscape for local agents and reconfiguring the organizational architecture within which agents adapt.},

In general, private investment and inequality do not show a monotone negative relationship.},

  abstract = {In this special section we propose an interpretation of the emergence and persistence of wealth inequality in premodern populations along with ethnographic and quantitative evidence exploring this hypothesis. The long-term trajectory of inequality in premodern societies, we suggest, is based on the differing importance of three classes of wealth\textemdash{}material, embodied, and relational\textemdash{}together with differences in the transmission of these types of wealth across generations. Subsequent essays in this forum use data on individual and household wealth from 21 populations to evaluate this and related propositions concerning the interaction of wealth class, transmission rates, production systems (foraging, horticultural, pastoral, and agricultural), and inequality. Here we motivate our interpretation by applying our ideas to the Holocene transition from more egalitarian to more stratified societies, introduce key concepts that are developed in the subsequent essays, and comment on some of the limitations of our study.},

The estimated relationship is robust   to variations in control variables and estimation methods. This inverted   U-curve is consistent with a simple political economy model but it could   also reflect the nature of measurement errors, and, in general, efforts   to interpret this evidence causally run into difficult identification   problems.

Government investment increases wealth inequality over time, regardless   of its financing.

Public investment generates a   positive correlation between growth and income inequality along the   transition path, but their short-run and long-run relationship depends   critically on (i) how externalities impinge on allocation decisions,   (ii) financing policies, and (iii) the time period of consideration.   Finally, these policies also generate sharp trade-offs between average   welfare and its distribution, with government investment improving   average welfare, but also increasing its dispersion.

Findings of   a significantly negative coefficient on income and a significantly   positive estimate on the quadratic term are commonly taken as evidence   supporting the inverted-U Kuznets curve. Although intuitive, Lind and   Mehlum (2010) argued that the conventional approach is flawed and   proposed an appropriate test for a U-shaped association. We revisit the   validity of the Kuznets hypothesis by applying the novel testing   strategy of Lind and Mehlum (2010) to annual US data over the period   1917 to 2007. Inconsistent with the Kuznets hypothesis, the test results   overwhelmingly reject the combined null hypothesis of an inverted-U or   monotone relationship in favour of a U-shaped linkage between income   inequality and economic development.

Firms belong to two industries. The first one performs R\&D and produces heterogeneous machine tools. Firms in the second industry invest in new machines and produce a homogenous consumption good. Consumers sell their labor and fully consume their income. In line with the empirical literature on investment patterns, we assume that firms' investment decisions are lumpy and constrained by their financial structure. Simulation results show that the model is able to deliver self-sustaining patterns of growth characterized by the presence of endogenous business cycles. The model can also replicate the most important stylized facts concerning micro- and macro-economic dynamics. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Unfortunately, computer-simulated models often lack such a reference to an accepted methodological standard. This is one of the main reasons for the scepticism among mainstream social scientists that results in low acceptance of papers with agent-based methodology in the top journals. We identify some methodological pitfalls that, according to us, are common in papers employing agent-based simulations, and propose appropriate solutions. We discuss each issue with reference to a general characterization of dynamic micro models, which encompasses both analytical and simulation models. In the way, we also clarify some confusing terminology. We then propose a three-stage process that could lead to the establishment of methodological standards in social and economic simulations.},

Two of the stylized facts of that market are high loyalty of buyers to sellers, and persistent price dispersion, although it is every day the same population of sellers and buyers that meets in the same market hall. In our ACE model, sellers decide on quantities to supply, prices to ask, and how to treat loyal customers, while buyers decide which sellers to visit, and which prices to accept. Learning takes place through reinforcement. The model explains both stylized facts price dispersion and high loyalty. In a coevolutionary process, buyers learn to become loyal as sellers learn to offer higher utility to loyal buyers, while these sellers, in turn, learn to offer higher utility to loyal buyers as they happen to realize higher gross revenues from loyal buyers. The model also explains the effect of heterogeneity of the buyers. We analyze how this leads to subtle differences in the shopping patterns of the different types of buyers, and how this is related to the behavior of the sellers in the market.},

In this paper, we compare two important approaches that are dominating ACE research and show that the above practice may hinder the performance of the evolutionary algorithm and thereby hinder agent learning. More specifically, we show that economic model parameters and evolutionary algorithm parameters should be treated separately by comparing the two widely used approaches to social learning with respect to their convergence properties and robustness.

Transaction cost economics neglects learning and the development of trust, ignores the complexity of multiple agents, and assumes rather than investigates the efficiency of outcomes. Efficiency here refers to minimum cost or maximum profit. We model how co-operation and trust emerge and shift adaptively as relations evolve in a context of multiple, interacting agents. This may open up a new area of application for the ACE methodology. A simulation model is developed in which agents make and break transaction relations on the basis of preferences, based on trust and potential profit. Profit is a function of product differentiation, specificity of assets, economy of scale and learning by doing in ongoing relations. Agents adapt their trust in a partner as a function of his loyalty, exhibited by his continuation of a relation. They also adapt the weight they attach to trust on the basis of realized profit. The model enables an assessment of the efficiency of outcomes relative to the optimum, as a function of trust and market conditions. We conduct a few experiments to illustrate this application of ACE.},

The approach emphasises the idea that the oil system is better modelled not as black-box abode of 'the invisible hand' but as a complex system whose macroscopic explananda emerges from the interactions of its constituent components. Given the estimated volumes of oil originally present before any extraction, simulations show that on average the world peak of crude oil production may happen in the broad vicinity of the time region between 2008 and 2027. Using the proposed petroleum market diversity, the market diversity weakness rapidly towards the peak year.},

  abstract = {We explore the effects of social influence in a simple market model in which a large number of agents face a binary choice: to buy/not to buy a single unit of a product at a price posted by a single seller (monopoly market). We consider the case of positive externalities: an agent is more willing to buy if other agents make the same decision. We consider two special cases of heterogeneity in the individuals' decision rules, corresponding in the literature to the Random Utility Models of Thurstone, and of McFadden and Manski. In the first one the heterogeneity fluctuates with time, leading to a standard model in Physics: the Ising model at finite temperature (known as annealed disorder) in a uniform external field. In the second approach the heterogeneity among agents is fixed; in Physics this is a particular case of the quenched disorder model known as a random field Ising model, at zero temperature. We study analytically the equilibrium properties of the market in the limiting case where each agent is influenced by all the others (the mean field limit), and we illustrate some dynamic properties of these models making use of numerical simulations in an Agent based Computational Economics approach. Considering the optimization of the profit by the seller within the case of fixed heterogeneity with global externality, we exhibit a new regime where, if the mean willingness to pay increases and/or the production costs decrease, the seller's optimal strategy jumps from a solution with a high price and a small number of buyers, to another one with a low price and a large number of buyers. This regime, usually modelled with ad hoc bimodal distributions of the idiosyncratic heterogeneity, arises here for general monomodal distributions if the social influence is strong enough.},

We explain how agent-based models (ABM), and, in particular agent-based computational economics (ACE), and analytically solvable heterogeneous interacting agent (ASHIA) models based on statistical physics or Markov chains can be used to deal with economies in which direct interaction between agents is important. This interaction leads to empirical regularities, which emerge from the system as a whole and cannot be identified by looking at any single agent in isolation: these emerging properties are, according to us, the main distinguishing feature of a complex system. In this way economics can free itself from the limitations of the static equilibrium approach, the use of the implausible representative agent approach and analyze the, possibly out of equilibrium, dynamics which seem more consistent with observed empirical data. The complexity approach is a very challenging line of research whose empirical results are very promising. Modeling an agent-based economy, however, remains a complex and complicated adventure.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is a new approach to modeling systems comprised of autonomous, interacting agents. ABMS promises to have far-reaching effects on the way that businesses use computers to support decision-making and researchers use electronic laboratories to support their research. Some have gone so far as to contend that ABMS is a third way of doing science besides deductive and inductive reasoning. Computational advances have made possible a growing number of agent-based applications in a variety of fields. Applications range from modeling agent behavior in the stock market and supply chains, to predicting the spread of epidemics and the threat of bio-warfare, from modeling consumer behavior to understanding the fall of ancient civilizations, to name a few. This tutorial describes the theoretical and practical foundations of ABMS, identifies toolkits and methods for developing ABMS models, and provides some thoughts on the relationship between ABMS and traditional modeling techniques.},

The fact that most ABMs are solved by simulation rather than analytically blurs the distinction between validation and verification. We suggest that a clear description of the phenomena to be explained by the model and testing for the simplest possible realistic agent rules of behaviour are key to the successful validation of ABMs and will provide the strongest base for enabling model comparison and acceptance. In particular, the empirical evidence that in general agents act intuitively rather than rationally is now strong. This implies that models which assign high levels of cognition to their agents require particularly strong justification if they are to be considered valid.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a technique increasingly used in a broad range of social sciences. It involves building a computational model consisting of ``agents,'' each of which represents an actor in the social world, and an "environment" in which the agents act. Agents are able to interact with each other and are programmed to be pro-active, autonomous and able to perceive their virtual world. The techniques of ABM are derived from artificial intelligence and computer science, but are now being developed independently in research centers throughout the world.In Agent-Based Models, Nigel Gilbert reviews a range of examples of agent-based modeling, describes how to design and build your own models, and considers practical issues such as verification, validation, planning a modeling project, and how to structure a scholarly article reporting the results of agent-based modeling. It includes a glossary, an annotated list of resources, advice on which programming environment to use when creating agent-based models, and a worked, step-by-step example of the development of an ABM.This latest volume in the SAGE Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences series will have wide appeal in the social sciences, including the disciplines of sociology, economics, social psychology, geography, economic history, science studies, and environmental studies. It is appropriate for graduate students, researchers and academics in these fields, for both those wanting to keep up with new developments in their fields and those who are considering using ABM for their research.Key FeaturesAimed at readers who are new to ABMOffers a brief, but thorough, treatment of a cutting-edge techniqueOffers practical advice about how to design and create ABMIncludes carefully chosen examples from different disciplinesLearn more about ``The Little Green Book'' - QASS Series!

His simulations show that the economy converges to the Walrasian equilibrium. Gintis concludes that 1) his stability results provide some justification for the importance placed upon the Walrasian model, and 2) models allowing agents to imitate successful others lead to an economy with a reasonable level of stability and efficiency. Since these conclusions appear to be intended as general, we caution that Gintis's findings can only be accepted for Walrasian models without capital goods in models with capital goods imitation-based adjustments alter the equilibrium's data (which makes the demonstration of stability impossible) and raise other important problems (absent from Gintis's simulations) still awaiting exploration.},

Their impact has been particularly strong within the central banking community, where policy analysis, policy simulation as well as forecasting are based on this class of models. More recently, these models have received a fair amount of criticism both from within and from outside the academic community. In this debate, agent-based models have frequently been discussed as potential competitors to DSGE models for modeling the macroeconomy. Like DSGE models, agent-based models describe economic behavior at the individual level; unlike DSGE models, agent-based models use the simulation capacity of modern computing technology to analyze the aggregate implications of individual behavior, enabling the analysis of a wide range of behavior, the description of fairly complex institutions as well as the study of system dynamics both out of and in equilibrium. In a research workshop held at OeNB on June 15 and 16, 2011, these competing modeling strategies were contrasted with each other to contribute to the discussion about the relative merits and problems of both approaches.},

This approach has been the cornerstone of modern economic theory. We explain why this is so, extolling the virtues of equilibrium theory; then we present a critique and describe why this approach is inherently limited, and why economics needs to move in new directions if it is to continue to make progress. We stress that this shouldn't be a question of dogma, but should be resolved empirically. There are situations where equilibrium models provide useful predictions and there are situations where they can never provide useful predictions. There are also many situations where the jury is still out, i.e., where so far they fail to provide a good description of the world, but where proper extensions might change this. Our goal is to convince the skeptics that equilibrium models can be useful, but also to make traditional economists more aware of the limitations of equilibrium models. We sketch some alternative approaches and discuss why they should play an important role in future research in economics.},

Computer simulation shows that it is possible for agents to act almost as if they had the additional necessary information to define and solve a standard optimization problem. Their behaviour gives rise endogenously to phenomena resembling Adam Smith's invisible hand. The results also indicate that agents must engage in some form of price comparison for decentralized markets to clear--otherwise there is no incentive for firms to respond to excess supply by lowering prices. This suggests that agent-based models with decentralized interaction risk untenable results if price-response decisions are made without being first directed toward the most favourable local price.},

In general, we find that allowing agents to move and choose new game play partners greatly increases the probability of attaining the Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium in coordination games. We also find that agent diversity increases the ability of agents to attain larger payoffs on average.},

The non-linear equations are solved numerically for a model economy. Numerical solutions for simple model economies suggest that the some of the results of general equilibrium economics are consequences only of the equilibrium hypothesis.

The socialist calculation debate and the elimination of competition by socialists in the Soviet Union offer insight into danger of using an equilibrium framework to study competition. Current policy models are based on a general equilibrium framework, but heterogeneous interactive agent-based models are rising to challenge them. Austrian economists should embrace this new direction and guide the creation of agent-based models of the economy.},

The players optimize bidding/offering strategies to participate in the electricity markets. In the second layer, responsive customers including plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) owners and consumers who participate in demand response (DR) programs are modeled as independent agents. The objective of the responsive customers is to increase their benefit while retaining welfare. The interaction between market players in day-ahead and real-time markets is modeled using an incomplete information game theory algorithm. Due to the uncertainties of resources and customers' behavior, the model is developed using a stochastic framework. A case study containing wind power producers (WPPs), PEV aggregators and retailers providing DR is considered to demonstrate the usefulness and proficiency of the proposed multi-layer agent-based model.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.116},
  abstract = {There has been increasing interest in new economic models that aim to improve quality of life without increasing consumption. This article provides the first empirical analysis of how close modern-day economies are to the concept of a ``steady-state economy'', and explores whether there is any relationship between a country's proximity to such an economy and its social performance. The analysis is carried out using the Degrowth Accounts, a set of 16 biophysical and social indicators that are derived from Herman Daly's definition of a steady-state economy and the social goals of the degrowth movement. These indicators are applied to $\sim$180 countries over a 10-year period. The analysis reveals that the majority of countries in the world are biophysical growth economies. There are only a small number of countries where resource use is relatively constant from year to year (e.g. Denmark, France, Japan, Poland, Romania, and the US), and only four countries experiencing biophysical degrowth (Germany, Guyana, Moldova, and Zimbabwe). There are no countries that achieve a true steady-state economy, defined as an economy with a stable level of resource use maintained within ecological limits. However, a few countries come relatively close, including Colombia, Cuba, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, and South Africa. In general, countries with stable resource use perform better on many social indicators than countries with either increasing or decreasing resource use. This finding runs contrary to conventional economic thought. However, social performance is also higher in countries with greater per capita resource use. Overall, these findings suggest that a steady-state economy can be socially sustainable, but countries need to become much more efficient at transforming natural resources into human well-being if all seven billion people on Earth are to lead a good life within ecological limits.},

Although Daly's definition gives a high-level view of what would be held steady in an SSE, it also leaves many questions unanswered. How should stocks and flows be aggregated? What is the role of international trade? How should nonrenewable resources be treated? And where does natural capital fit in? To help answer these questions, I relate Daly's definition to key concepts and terminology from material and energy flow accounting. I explore topics such as aggregation, international trade, the relevance of throughput, and hidden flows. I conclude that a set of biophysical accounts for an SSE should include three types of indicators (stocks, flows, and scale), track how stocks and flows are changing over a 5- to 10-year period, use aggregated data that measure the quantity of resource use (rather than its quality), measure both total and nonrenewable resource use, adopt a consumption-based approach, include hidden flows, and exclude indicators that measure characteristics of the stock of natural capital (with the notable exception of indicators that measure the regenerative and assimilative capacities of ecosystems).},

Second, the lack of relevant empirical data precludes many models from being appropriately initialized and validated, limiting the value of such models for exploring emergent properties or for policy evaluation. To address these issues, in this paper we present a theoretically-based and empirically-driven agent-based model of technology adoption, with an application to residential solar photovoltaic (PV). Using household-level resolution for demographic, attitudinal, social network, and environmental variables, the integrated ABM framework we develop is applied to real-world data covering 2004\textendash{}2013 for a residential solar PV program at the city scale.

This paper revisits the issue of evaluation in natural resource management and recasts it in light of complex adaptive systems thinking. An evaluative framework for adaptive co-management is developed which directs attention toward three broad components: ecosystem conditions, livelihood outcomes and process and institutional conditions. Scale-specific parameters are offered for each component to facilitate systematic learning from experience and encourage cross-site comparisons. Conclusions highlight the importance of systematically incorporating evaluation into the adaptive co-management process and recognize the challenge for resource agencies and researchers to shift from a conventional to a complex adaptive system perspective.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a stylized economy-energy-climate model and discuss the role of the atmosphere, fossil fuels, and a stock of accumulated knowledge about renewable energy technologies in collaboratively and competitively managed worlds. The model highlights that assumptions about the `degree of competition' and about choices of lumping economic regions, and hence their heterogeneity, strongly affect model predictions about the rate of fossil fuel use and, consequently, the rate of climate change.

In the model, decisionmakers (actors) make decisions about investment allocations into the goods producing economy and into carbon-based and non-carbon-based (renewable) energy supply, the remainder being for consumption. Actors are faced with the following dilemma situation.

Economic growth requires energy and will therefore accelerate fossil fuel depletion and generate growth in carbon emissions, the latter leading to global warming and climate change induced damages. By developing non-carbon energy sources, which come initially at a higher cost than fossil fuels, growth of carbon emissions can be curtailed. Trying to optimize a consumption-related utility, actors base their decisions on the economically most rational investment portfolio for a finite time horizon. However, in their decisionmaking, they are constrained by the choices of other actors.

We consider two prototypical situations: (i) a collaborative environment where all actors strive to maximize a world utility \textendash{} the global optimum \textendash{} and (ii) a situation where actors optimize the utility of their own country \textendash{} a solution that corresponds to a Nash equilibrium. The difference between both outcomes can be used to classify the severity of the `tragedy of the commons effect'. We present results about the dependence of the severity of this effect on several key parameters (i) the number of actors, (ii) the heterogeneity and severity of expected climate damages, (iii) assumptions about technology diffusion and (iv) fossil fuel depletion.},

Arguably, the resulting ``ecological econophysics'' will be scientifically sounder than mainstream economics and much better suited to addressing a major challenge of our times: the development of democratically-based policies to reduce economic throughput to an environmentally sustainable level without triggering economic crises and without excluding part of the world's population, i.e., to implement degrowth. Degrowth will need major structural changes, which leads us to question whether there are limits to the malleability of the economic system's architecture. A fundamental limit will be encountered if, as suggested by the physics of complexity, long-lasting complex systems always occur midway between an ordered and a disordered state. There is much evidence that this hypothesis holds and that the current economic system satisfies this condition. However, this does not mean that the problems posed by this system should be unavoidable. Ecological econophysics gives clues to identifying alternative economic systems that would also function between order and chaos, but which would have radically different implications for environmental sustainability and social justice.},

  abstract = {Model-based support of climate policy is scientifically challenging because climate change involves linked physical and social systems that operate on multiple levels: local, national, and international. As a result, models must employ some strongly simplifying assumptions. The most frequently used models typically assume hyper-rational and homogenous human behavior. These ensure tractability but, as a trade-off, abstract away the effects of less-than-rational decision-making and actor heterogeneity on domestic policy effectiveness and the influence of domestic constituents on international policy agreement. In this paper, we introduce a multi-level model framework, called ENGAGE, that relaxes some common modeling assumptions by adopting an agent-based approach. ENGAGE is styled after the Putnam two-level game, in which negotiators at the international level are constrained by the heterogeneous policy preferences and power of constituents at the domestic level. We proceed to provide a detailed description and demonstration of the prototype domestic-level module. Domestic actors include firms and households who function as agents within an evolutionary representation of economic growth, energy technology, and climate change. This allows an evaluation of policies that accounts for agent decision-making and social and technological change. Ultimately, we plan to use the ENGAGE model to simulate the two-way dynamic feedback between international agreements and domestic policy outcomes.},

  abstract = {Axenic, washed conidia of Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli, Aspergillus flavus, and Verticillium albo-atrum were placed on washed Difco purified agar discs along with an inorganic salt solution containing various levels of carbon and nitrogen substrates. These discs were exposed to volatiles from six soils (pH 5.1-8.6). Fusarium solani macroconidial germination was inhibited mostly by volatiles from soils of pH 5.1, 6.1, 7.0, and 7.5, but high levels of glucose and NH4Cl reversed this inhibition, raising germination to that of no-soil, no-carbon or nitrogen controls. Conidial germination of A. flavus was inhibited mainly by volatiles from high pH (7.0, 7.8, and 8.6) soils, and increased levels of glucose plus an amino acid mixture nullified this inhibition. Volatiles from soils of pH 5.1, 6.1, and 7.5 stimulated A. flavus conidial germination. Assays after the removal of CO2 from the air above soil of pH 5.1 demonstrated that volatiles inhibitory to A. flavus were produced by this soil. Assays indicated that a KOH-soluble compound was a fungistatic soil volatile to F. solani macroconidial germination. The nullification by carbon and nitrogen substrates of F. solani and A. flavus inhibition caused by soil volatiles parallels that for soil fungistasis. Conidial germination of V. albo-atrum was markedly stimulated by volatiles in all soils tested, and was not affected by removal of CO2. Inhibitory soil volatiles may increase the nutritional requirements for spore germination of certain fungi.},

  volume = {14},
  issn = {0006-2960},
  abstract = {Kinetic analyses of monoanion inhibition and 15Cl nuclear magnetic resonance at 5.88 MHz were employed to study monoanion interactions with the zinc metalloenzyme, renal dipeptidase. The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of glycyldehydrophenylalanine exhibited competitive inhibition when the reaction rate was determined in the presence of the monovalent anions fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, nitrate, or thiocyanate or upon the addition of the divalent anion, sulfate. Competitive inhibition was produced by these anions. One anion was bound per enzyme molecule, and except in the case of fluoride all of the anions appeared to bind at the same site. Cyanide ion produced a much more effective inhibition of renal dipeptidase than the other monoanions, and it was shown that two cyanide ions were bound per enzyme molecule. An investigation of the effect of pH upon monoanion inhibition suggested that the anion inhibitors bind to the group with a pK of approximately 7.8. Complete dissociation of this group (approximately pH 8.4) eliminates the inhibitory effect of anions. The 35Cl line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase in 0.5 M NaCl solutions was 100 times more effective than that produced by equivalent concentrations of aquozinc(II). The line broadening was dependent upon the concentration of the metalloenzyme and independent of the frequency of the exciting radiation. When zinc ion was removed from the metalloenzyme by dialysis or when chloride was titrated from the metalloenzyme by cyanide, line broadening was decreased. Treatment of renal dipeptidase with saturating concentrations of the competitive inhibitor, guanosine triphosphate, in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl also produced a significant decrease in the 35Cl line width. The 35Cl line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase was shown to decrease with increasing pH through the range pH 5.8-10.8. This line-width variation with pH appeared to result from the titration of a site on the metalloprotein with an approximate pK of 7.4. Temperature studies of 35Cl line broadening by the metalloenzyme in the presence of chloride and cyanide inhibitors suggest that the fast exchange process pertains and that the dominant relaxation mechanism is quadrupolar in nature.},

A theme lacking from the present discourse is that of the sustainability of population health. To be sustainable, societies must respect the boundaries of natural systems and scorn disparities in standards of living. Preliminary analysis of data from 152 countries reveals an inverse relation between measures of population health and sustainability, although there are examples of societies where this inverse relation does not hold. Future research in population health should begin to question the sustainability of improving the health of some populations at the expense of others, and investigate how some societies appear to be able to achieve population health without compromising the health of the biosphere.},

  abstract = {The ecosystem model FORECAST was used to evaluate the sustainability of current management practices in Pinus caribaea plantations in Pinar del R{\'\i}o (western Cuba). Model predictions were within the range of observed field measurements of height, diameter, stem density and volume. The model performed reasonably well in capturing general growth trends (r values for dominant height, diameter and merchantable volume were 0.91, 0.77 and 0.81 respectively). In the second part of our work, model output of merchantable volume, stem biomass, soil organic matter and available N in soil were analysed in 18 different combinations of rotation length (25 vs. 50 years), thinning intensity (0, 15 and 30\% stems) and fertilisation (0, 50 and 100 kg ha-1 N) in order to study the effects of different management regimes on site fertility. Our results indicated that some of the current prescriptions could produce a considerable loss of nitrogen, and in some cases, a decrease in productivity after the third 25-year rotation. However, other prescriptions can keep productivity and soil organic matter at acceptable levels. The results of our analysis illustrated the portability and utility of FORECAST as a scenario-analysis and decision-support tool in managing pine plantations in the Caribbean region and, potentially, elsewhere. Model ekosistem FORECAST diguna untuk menilai kemampanan amalan pengurusan semasa di ladang Pinus caribaea di Pinar del R{\'\i}o (barat Cuba). Ramalan model termasuk dalam julat cerapan ukuran lapangan bagi ketinggian, diameter, ketumpatan batang dan isi padu. Prestasi model agak baik dalam menawan data umum tumbesaran (nilai r bagi ketinggian dominan, diameter dan isi padu boleh niaga masing-masing ialah 0.91, 0.77 dan 0.81). Dalam bahagian kedua kajian ini, output model bagi isi padu boleh niaga, biojisim batang, bahan organik tanah dan N tersedia dalam tanah dianalisis dalam 18 kombinasi berbeza bagi tempoh pusingan (25 dan 50 tahun), keamatan penjarangan (0, 15\% dan 30\% batang) serta pembajaan (0, 50 kg ha-1 N dan 100 kg ha-1 N). Tujuannya untuk mengkaji kesan amalan pengurusan yang berbeza terhadap kesuburan tapak. Keputusan menunjukkan bahawa sesetengah panduan semasa mungkin mengakibatkan kehilangan nitrogen yang agak besar dan dalam beberapa kes turut mengakibatkan pengurangan hasil selepas pusingan 25 tahun. Bagaimanapun, panduan lain dapat mengekalkan hasil serta bahan organik tanah pada tahap yang memuaskan. Keputusan analisis menunjukkan kemudahalihan dan utiliti FORECAST sebagai alat analisis senario dan sokongan dalam membuat keputusan apabila menguruskan ladang pain di daerah Caribbean dan mungkin juga di tempat lain.},

  shorttitle = {Agricultural {{Sustainability}}},
  abstract = {Concerns about sustainability in agricultural systems centre on the need to develop technologies and practices that do not have adverse effects on environmental goods and services, are accessible to and effective for farmers, and lead to improvements in food productivity. Despite great progress in agricultural productivity in the past half-century, with crop and livestock productivity strongly driven by increased use of fertilizers, irrigation water, agricultural machinery, pesticides and land, it would be over-optimistic to assume that these relationships will remain linear in the future. New approaches are needed that will integrate biological and ecological processes into food production, minimize the use of those non-renewable inputs that cause harm to the environment or to the health of farmers and consumers, make productive use of the knowledge and skills of farmers, so substituting human capital for costly external inputs, and make productive use of people's collective capacities to work together to solve common agricultural and natural resource problems, such as for pest, watershed, irrigation, forest and credit management. These principles help to build important capital assets for agricultural systems: natural; social; human; physical; and financial capital. Improving natural capital is a central aim, and dividends can come from making the best use of the genotypes of crops and animals and the ecological conditions under which they are grown or raised. Agricultural sustainability suggests a focus on both genotype improvements through the full range of modern biological approaches and improved understanding of the benefits of ecological and agronomic management, manipulation and redesign. The ecological management of agroecosystems that addresses energy flows, nutrient cycling, population-regulating mechanisms and system resilience can lead to the redesign of agriculture at a landscape scale. Sustainable agriculture outcomes can be positive for food productivity, reduced pesticide use and carbon balances. Significant challenges, however, remain to develop national and international policies to support the wider emergence of more sustainable forms of agricultural production across both industrialized and developing countries.},

  abstract = {Sustainability or collapse follow from the success or failure of problem-solving institutions. The factors that lead to long-term success or failure in problem solving have received little attention, so that this fundamental activity is poorly understood. The capacity of institutions to solve problems changes over time, suggesting that a science of problem solving, and thus a science of sustainability, must be historical. Complexity is a primary problem-solving strategy, which is often successful in the short-term, but cumulatively may become detrimental to sustainability. Historical case studies illustrate different outcomes to long-term development of complexity in problem solving. These cases clarify future options for contemporary societies: collapse, simplification, or increasing complexity based on increasing energy subsidies.},

Much less, however, is known about the seller's preferred selling method when the buyers have a common value of the item. Our objective is to determine if a first-price auction or a posted-price market provides a seller with the larger expected revenue when buyers have a common value of the item being sold. An agent-based posted-price market and an agent-based first-price common-value auction with a reserve price are developed to compare these selling methods. Holding the buyers' uncertainty about the value of the item constant, the seller prefers the posted-price market when the seller has no uncertainty about the item's value. When the seller has an equal level of uncertainty as the buyers, the seller's expected revenue for each market is similar. As the seller's uncertainty increases beyond the level of the buyers' uncertainty, the auction with a reserve price eventually becomes the preferred choice.},

It demonstrates how ABM can easily handle complexity: heterogeneous people, households and firms interacting dynamically. Unlike traditional methods, ABM does not require people or firms to optimise or economic systems to reach equilibrium. ABM offers a way to link micro foundations directly to the macro situation. "Key features" Introduces the concept of agent-based modelling and shows how it differs from existing approaches. Provides a theoretical and methodological rationale for using ABM in economics, along with practical advice on how to design and create the models. Each chapter starts with a short summary of the relevant economic theory and then shows how to apply ABM. Explores both topics covered in basic economics textbooks and current important policy themes; unemployment, exchange rates, banking and environmental issues. Describes the models in pseudocode, enabling the reader to develop programs in their chosen language. Supported by a website featuring the NetLogo models described in the book. "Agent-based Modelling in Economics "provides students and researchers with the skills to design, implement, and analyze agent-based models. Third year undergraduate, master and doctoral students, faculty and professional economists will find this book an invaluable resource.},

The speed at which a transition can take place\textemdash{}its timing, or temporal dynamics\textemdash{}is a critical element of consideration. This study therefore investigates the issue of time in global and national energy transitions by asking: What does the mainstream academic literature suggest about the time scale of energy transitions? Additionally, what does some of the more recent empirical data related to transitions say, or challenge, about conventional views? In answering these questions, the article presents a ``mainstream'' view of energy transitions as long, protracted affairs, often taking decades to centuries to occur. However, the article then offers some empirical evidence that the predominant view of timing may not always be supported by the evidence. With this in mind, the final part of the article argues for more transparent conceptions and definitions of energy transitions, and it asks for analysis that recognizes the causal complexity underlying them.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modeling is a new technique for understanding how the dynamics of biological, social, and other complex systems arise from the characteristics and behaviors of the agents making up these systems. This innovative textbook gives students and scientists the skills to design, implement, and analyze agent-based models. It starts with the fundamentals of modeling and provides an introduction to NetLogo, an easy-to-use, free, and powerful software platform. Nine chapters then each introduce an important modeling concept and show how to implement it using NetLogo. The book goes on to present strategies for finding the right level of model complexity and developing theory for agent behavior, and for analyzing and learning from models.  Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling features concise and accessible text, numerous examples, and exercises using small but scientific models. The emphasis throughout is on analysis--such as software testing, theory development, robustness analysis, and understanding full models--and on design issues like optimizing model structure and finding good parameter values.

Contributing factors that lead to extreme values include high geopolitical concentration of primary production, lack of available suitable substitutes, and political instability. The results show that the limitations for many metals important in emerging electronics (e.g., gallium and selenium) are largely those related to supply risk; those of platinum group metals, gold, and mercury, to environmental implications; and steel alloying elements (e.g., chromium and niobium) as well as elements used in high-temperature alloys (e.g., tungsten and molybdenum), to vulnerability to supply restriction. The metals of most concern tend to be those available largely or entirely as byproducts, used in small quantities for highly specialized applications, and possessing no effective substitutes.},

  abstract = {In-use stock of a product is the amount of the product in active use. In-use product stocks provide various functions or services on which we rely in our daily work and lives, and the concept of in-use product stock for industrial ecologists is similar to the concept of net manufactured capital stock for economists. This study estimates historical physical in-use stocks of 91 products and 9 product groups and uses monetary data on net capital stocks of 56 products to either approximate or compare with in-use stocks of the corresponding products in the United States. Findings include the following: (i) The development of new products and the buildup of their in-use stocks result in the increase in variety of in-use product stocks and of manufactured capital; (ii) substitution among products providing similar or identical functions reflects the improvement in quality of in-use product stocks and of manufactured capital; and (iii) the historical evolution of stocks of the 156 products or product groups in absolute, per capita, or per-household terms shows that stocks of most products have reached or are approaching an upper limit. Because the buildup, renewal, renovation, maintenance, and operation of in-use product stocks drive the anthropogenic cycles of materials that are used to produce products and that originate from natural capital, the determination of in-use product stocks together with modeling of anthropogenic material cycles provides an analytic perspective on the material linkage between manufactured capital and natural capital.},

  abstract = {The debate over the Cobb-Douglas production function has been raging ever since the mathematician Charles Cobb teamed up in 1928 with the economist Paul Douglas and developed this famous model of aggregate production and distribution. This article presents a heretofore unpublished exchange in 1971 over the efficacy of the Cobb-Douglas by two future Nobel Laureates, Robert Solow and Herbert Simon. Solow emerges as the defender of the Cobb-Douglas, and Simon the engaging critic. The correspondence demonstrates that the logical and empirical problems with the Cobb-Douglas were well known by the most advanced minds of mainstream economics. This calls into question the rationale for its continued use as an empirical corroboration of marginal productivity theory.},

  abstract = {In their recent book, Colander and Kupers (2014) argue that viewing the economy as a complex adaptive system should change the way in which we make economic policy. This would necessitate a paradigm shift. Economics has, over time, tried to produce a coherent model to underpin the dominant laissez-faire liberal approach. But we have never proved, in that model, that left to their own devices, the participants in an economy will self-organize into a satisfactory state. This is an assumption. Complex interactive systems with direct interaction between heterogeneous agents may show no tendency to self-equilibrate and will undergo endogenous crises. Economists should concentrate on the emergence of certain patterns. Colander and Kupers suggest that we may be able to nudge the system into "good" basins of attraction. A more radical view is that there are no fixed basins of attraction; these change with the evolution of the system and it is illusory to believe that we can choose good basins. We may be able to recognize and influence the emergence of certain states of the economy, but we are far from Leon Walras's dream of economics as a science like astrophysics.},

Unfortunately, economists' policy models have not kept up and are stuck in either a market fundamentalist or government control narrative. While these standard narratives are useful in some cases, they are damaging in others, directing thinking away from creative, innovative policy solutions. Complexity and the Art of Public Policy outlines a new, more flexible policy narrative, which envisions society as a complex evolving system that is uncontrollable but can be influenced. David Colander and Roland Kupers describe how economists and society became locked into the current policy framework, and lay out fresh alternatives for framing policy questions. Offering original solutions to stubborn problems, the complexity narrative builds on broader philosophical traditions, such as those in the work of John Stuart Mill, to suggest initiatives that the authors call ``activist laissez-faire'' policies. Colander and Kupers develop innovative bottom-up solutions that, through new institutional structures such as for-benefit corporations, channel individuals' social instincts into solving societal problems, making profits a tool for change rather than a goal. They argue that a central role for government in this complexity framework is to foster an ecostructure within which diverse forms of social entrepreneurship can emerge and blossom.},

After two centuries of studying equilibria \textemdash{} patterns of consistency that call for no further behavioral adjustments \textemdash{} economists are beginning to study the unfolding of patterns in the economy. That is, we are starting to study the economy out of equilibrium. This way of doing economics calls for an algorithmic approach.

  abstract = {A new view of the economy as an evolving, complex system has been pioneered at the Santa Fe Institute over the last ten years, This volume is a collection of articles that shape and define this view\textemdash{}a view of the economy as emerging from the interactions of individual agents whose behavior constantly evolves, whose strategies and actions are always adapting.The traditional framework in economics portrays activity within an equilibrium steady state. The interacting agents in the economy are typically homogenous, solve well-defined problems using perfect rationality, and act within given legal and social structures. The complexity approach, by contrast, sees economic activity as continually changing\textemdash{}continually in process. The interacting agents are typically heterogeneous, they must cognitively interpret the problems they face, and together they create the structures\textemdash{}markets, legal and social institutions, price patters, expectations\textemdash{}to which they individually react. Such structures may never settle down. Agents may forever adapt and explore and evolve their behaviors within structures that continually emerge and change and disappear\textemdash{}structures these behaviors co-create. This complexity approach does not replace the equilibrium one\textemdash{}it complements it.The papers here collected originated at a recent conference at the Santa Fe Institute, which was called to follow up the well-known 1987 SFI conference organized by Philip Anderson, Kenneth Arrow, and David Pines. They survey the new study of complexity and the economy.

Modern innovations such as personal                 computers, laser surgery, jet airplanes, and satellite communication have made us                 rich and transformed the way we live and work. But technological change has also                 brought with it a variety of social problems. It has been blamed at various times                 for increasing wage and income inequality, unemployment, obsolescence of physical                 and human capital, environmental deterioration, and prolonged                 recessions.To understand the contradictory effects of                 technological change on the economy, one must delve into structural details of the                 innovation process to analyze how laws, institutions, customs, and regulations                 affect peoples' incentive and ability to create new knowledge and profit from it. To                 show how this can be done, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt make use of Schumpeter's                 concept of creative destruction, the competitive process whereby entrepreneurs                 constantly seek new ideas that will render their rivals' ideas                 obsolete.Whereas other books on endogenous growth stress a                 particular aspect, such as trade or convergence, this book provides a comprehensive                 survey of the theoretical and empirical debates raised by modern growth theory. It                 develops a powerful engine of analysis that sheds light not only on economic growth                 per se, but on the many other phenomena that interact with growth, such as                 inequality, unemployment, capital accumulation, education, competition, natural                 resources, international trade, economic cycles, and public policy.},

In particular, the paper demonstrates that if firms can appropriate a sufficient share of the intertemporal return from knowledge generating activities of their labor force, a gradual increase in the supply of skilled workers would generate only a temporary reduction in the skill premium followed by a permanent increase in the return to skill.},

Consequently, tougher competition implies larger firm size and higher rates of innovation since new technologies can be applied in a larger market.

We use a Hotelling-style model with two non-renewable fossil fuels that differ in their carbon content (e.g., coal and natural gas) and in addition are imperfect substitutes in final good production. We show that an economy facing a CO₂ flow-constraint may substitute towards the relatively dirty input. As the economy tries to maximize output per unit of emissions it is not only carbon content that matters: productivity matters as well. With an announced constraint the economy first substitutes towards the less productive input such that more of the productive input is available when constrained. Preliminary empirical results suggest that it is cost-effective to substitute away from dirty coal to cleaner oil or gas, but to substitute from natural gas towards the dirtier input oil. /// On {\'e}tudie comment les restrictions sur les {\'e}missions de CO₂ affectent les prix des ressources et leur {\'e}puisement dans le temps.

  abstract = {The paper discusses the relation between imperfect competition and technological change induced by R\&D in the context of a general equilibrium model. There are two sectors, a traditional and a high-tech sector. Competition in the high-tech sector is Chamberlinian or oligopolistic. R\&D is conceived as an in-house activity of firms. It is also a fixed cost for the firm. With free entry the number of firms is endogenous and the smaller the number of firms the higher will be R\&D within each firm. If R\&D is considered as an investment the model generates an endogenous rate of growth. It is shown that oligopolic behaviour induces a lower rate of growth than monopolistic competition, with the Bertrand solution outranking the Cournot solution. In any case considered, there is a positive relation between concentration and growth, vindicating the well-known Schumpeter hypothesis.},

  abstract = {The effects of increased environmental care on optimal technology choice and long-term growth are studied for an economy in which pollution is a side-product of physical capital used in production. First, it is shown that in case of a standard neoclassical production structure, the result is a less capital-intensive production process whereas the long-run growth rate is not affected. Next, we introduce assumptions of the endogenous growth literature. When there are constant returns to physical capital, an increase in abatement activities crowds out investment and lowers the endogenous growth rate. When human capital accumulation is the engine of growth, physical capital intensity declines and the endogenous optimal growth rate is unaffected by increased environmental care or is even higher, depending on whether or not pollution influences agents' ability to learn.},

We show that there is no a priori assurance of substantial positive spillovers from environmental policies to income growth, or for a monotonic transition to a `green steady state' along an optimal path. The greenness of an optimal growth path can depend heavily on initial conditions, with a variety of different adjustments occurring concurrently along an optimal path.

  abstract = {The relationship between economic growth and the environment is, and will always remain, controversial. Some see the emergence of new pollution problems, the lack of success in dealing with global warming and the still rising population in the Third World as proof positive that humans are a short-sighted and rapacious species. Others however see the glass as half full. They note the tremendous progress made in providing urban sanitation, improvements in air quality in major cities and marvel at the continuing improvements in the human condition made possible by technological advance. The first group focuses on the remaining and often serious environmental problems of the day; the second on the long, but sometimes erratic, history of improvement in living standards. These views are not necessarily inconsistent and growth theory offers us the tools needed to explore the link between environmental problems of today and the likelihood of their improvement tomorrow. This review articles discusses and evaluates the theoretical literature linking environmental quality to economic growth. We focus on three questions. These are: (1) what is the relationship between economic growth and the environment? (2) how can we escape the limits to growth imposed by environmental constraints? and (3) where should future research focus its efforts? For the most part, we discuss the link between industrial pollution and growth, but also show how this most recent work is related to earlier contributions on exhaustible resources and growth. While no review can settle the perennial debate over the limits to growth, this review moves the literature forward by identifying important unresolved theoretical questions, reports on the results of recent empirical work, and provides an integrative assessment of where we stand today.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00181-015-0964-5},
  abstract = {This paper examines the conditional convergence of carbon dioxide emissions in 11 Asian countries over the period of 1972-2009. We allow for spatial dependence in emissions across countries to consider the possibility that country's emissions are affected by emissions in neighboring countries. We utilize the spatial Durbin model (SDM) and spatial lag model (SAM) estimation for the Green Solow model and also employ distribution dynamics using the nonparametric method with three different emission samples: per capita , relative , and intensities. We found that emissions are significantly influenced by the emissions of neighboring countries. These test results on SDM for per capita and SAM for intensities do not support the convergence hypothesis. However, when we control for both the individual and time-period fixed effects, for relative and intensities, SAM supports the convergence hypothesis. With the distributional dynamics approach adapting spatial-filtering and HP-filtering techniques before proceeding with the estimate of the stochastic kernel, we find that per capita and intensities indicate a strong tendency toward convergence in Asian countries over the entire period, yet relative shows dynamics with a switch toward divergence. In conclusion, the emission intensities among Asian countries strongly support the convergence to the long-run steady state of emissions as Asian economies develop. However, relative emissions in Asian countries do not converge with the long-run steady-state level of developed countries as sustainable growth paths are predicted from the theoretical Solow model.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.econmod.2016.01.017},
  abstract = {Sustainability and optimality are the two main issues discussed in environmental economics and economic growth theory. This paper studies economic growth in the presence of two environmental externalities. The first one is local and gives account of the marginal damage from the emissions flow. The second one is aggregate, or global, and relates to the extreme damage which may happen if the accumulated stock of pollutants is on the threshold of a worldwide catastrophe. In this context, the decentralized equilibrium is inefficient and economic growth unsustainable. However, we find and completely characterize the socially optimal equilibrium, which shows that sustained growth is feasible along the balanced path. Efficiency alone is not sufficient for sustainability, but Pareto optimality is necessary to produce sustainable outcomes. According to our results, the sustainability of the optimal sustained long-run growth depends on environmental constraints, production and abatement technologies, individual preferences, and population dynamics. This means that government has a clear incentive for intervention by means of direct and indirect policies. These ones cover the usual Pigouvian taxes and subsidies, the setting of emission standards, and the public provision of abatement. Moreover, the government can promote eco-efficiency in the use of materials, implement information campaigns that influence social preferences for environmental conservation, or even put into action population controls and other measures that encourage the demographic transition.

  shorttitle = {Geographical Spread of Global Emissions},
  abstract = {In spite of the extensive literature on greenhouse gas emission inequalities at the world-wide level, most of the evidence so far has been based on country-level data. However, the within-country dimension matters for both the implementation and the policy formation of climate policies. As a preliminary step towards a better understanding of within-country inequalities, this paper measures their extent for the two major greenhouse gases, CO2 and CH4, over the 1970-2008 period. Using Theil-index decompositions, we show that within-country inequalities account for the bulk of global inequality, and tend to increase over the sample period, in contrast with diminishing between-country inequalities. Including differences across sectors reveals that between-sector inequalities matter more than between-country inequalities, and between-sector inequalities become the dominant source of global inequality at the end of the sample period in the CO2 case. Finally, estimated social tensions arising from the disconnection between emissions and future damages turn out to be increasing as soon as within-country disparities are taken into account. These orders of magnitude should be kept in mind while discussing the efficiency and fairness of alternative paths in combating global warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {As China's economy has grown rapidly in recent years, China's environmental pollution has become increasingly significant. Among all the traditional pollutants, sulfur dioxide has been monitored by the Chinese government since the 1990s. In this study, China's city-level panel data between 2002 and 2012 are utilized to investigate the existence of convergence in per capita sulfur dioxide emissions across Chinese cities. The conventional estimation methods for beta-convergence suffer from an endogeneity problem and therefore produce biased results. To address the endogeneity problem and allow for dynamics, dynamic panel data estimators are utilized, and the static estimation results are conducted as a robustness check. In addition, the influential factors for convergence are examined. The empirical results indicate that, in the chosen sample period, there were absolute and conditional convergences in per capita sulfur dioxide emissions across cities within the whole nation as well as in the eastern, western and central regions of China. Because per capita Gross Domestic Product and the ratio of secondary industry to Gross Domestic Product are both positively related with per capita sulfur dioxide emissions, higher income per capita and greater importance of the secondary industry would cause the convergence speed to be lower. Therefore, the most straightforward policy implication for the empirical results is that the policies for controlling sulfur dioxide emissions should be regionally differentiated: for cities with high sulfur dioxide emissions per capita, the regulation could be tight, as the emissions would decrease faster because convergence exists; however, for cities with low sulfur dioxide emissions per capita, the target for reducing emissions should not be excessively aggressive.

The model assumes pollution as a by-product of production. The stock of pollution has a negative impact on production. The accumulation of pollution is dampened by a share of the investments, in the form of an environmental tax. We consider a linear region where both capital and pollution can diffuse. This economic-environmental model is described by a pair of partial differential equations whose dynamics and steady state characteristics with respect to time and space are studied. Then we look at this ambient environment from the point of view of a social planner who can act on the consumption and taxation, also functions of time and space, considering the dynamics of capital and pollution as constraints.},

  abstract = {We analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of capital and pollution in an economic growth model with purposive environmental protection activities. The production process of a unique homogeneous good generates pollution, thus the increases in output associated with economic growth tend to rise the stock of pollution. Pollution is a negative production externality which thus feeds back on the economy lowering the level of output; in order to compensate for such a negative effect associated with economic development, pollution is reduced by publicly funded abatement activities. We firstly consider a Solow-type framework in which economic and environmental policies are completely exogenous, and then we move to a Ramsey-type context in which they are endogenously determined. We analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of the model economy through numerical simulations, and we consider two different specifications Of the production function (a globally concave and a convex-concave technology) in order to stress the role that eventual poverty traps might play on both economic and environmental outcomes. We show that in the convex-concave technology framework, whenever rich regions are substantially rich diffusion can help poor regions to escape their poverty traps; if however they are not rich enough diffusion might condemn also rich regions to collapse. However, even if rich regions are particularly rich whenever the pollution externality is strong, the whole spatial economy might be doomed to collapse. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Our analysis also shows that, contrary to the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), environmental quality cannot be maintained or improved via economic growth. Instead, the improvement in environmental quality, as measured by a reduction in pollution, can only be achieved by an increase in the environmental self-renewal rate or the recycling ratio.

We calculate the new steady states, transition paths to the new steady state, and the size of the associated welfare losses or gains. Our main results for a 15\% cut in energy subsidies are: (1) Steady state gross domestic product drops in most of our experiments as less energy is used in production. (2) Steady state consumption rises in most of our experiments. (3) Welfare can rise by as much as 0.6\% in consumption equivalent terms. (4) The largest gains in terms of output and of welfare can be obtained when savings from energy subsidy cuts are used to fund additional infrastructure investment. (JEL E21, E63, H55, J26, J45)},

  abstract = {We investigate carbon emission trends among EU Member States by testing the assumption of beta-type convergence in per capita CO2 emissions, conditional upon per capita output, world oil price, energy use per capita and investment in renewable energy. Our study supports the assumption of conditional convergence among all EU Member States. It should take around 10 years for the EU-15 countries to stabilize their per capita emissions. This result holds if we include the new Member States in the sample. We also find that the emission growth/GDP relation is strictly negative, indicating that EU-15 countries switched to a less carbon intensive economy starting from the early 1990s. This result remains robust when the new Member States are included. We therefore argue that the decline in EU carbon emissions is a long-term trend and not a result of the economic crisis. We then discuss the effectiveness of climate and energy policies and the EU burden-sharing agreement. Some countries like Germany, Great Britain and France can meet their carbon targets without adopting more aggressive climate and energy policies by 2020. Other EU-15 Member States can reduce their domestic emissions beyond their targets if they adopt energy-efficient technologies. Most of the new Member States emit much less than their domestic targets even when per capita income and oil price increase.},

Our approach differs from previous work on carbon convergence in that it employs a theoretical framework to construct a CO2 performance index, which explicitly takes into account that industrial firms produce good as well as bad outputs. This index is then used as the dependent variable in a growth-type regression equation. We employ a data set covering 14 industrial sectors over the time period 1990-2008. The results suggest the presence of conditional beta-convergence in CO2 performance among the industrial sectors in Sweden. Moreover, the speed of convergence varies significantly in the sense that the higher the capital intensity is, the lower is the convergence rate to the different steady states. This is likely to reflect the importance of - and in part the costs associated with - capital turnover to achieve a transition towards lower CO2 emission paths. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {We construct a hybrid, economic indicator of the sustainability of global well-being, which is more inclusive than existing indicators and incorporates an environmentally pessimistic, physical constraint on global warming. Our methodology extends the World Bank's Adjusted Net Saving (ANS) indicator to include the cost of population growth, the benefit of technical progress, and a much higher, precautionary cost of current CO2 emissions. Future warming damage is so highly unknowable that valuing emissions directly is rather arbitrary, so we use a novel, inductive approach: we modify damage and climate parameters in the deterministic DICE climate-economy model so it becomes economically optimal to control emissions in a way likely to limit warming to an agreed target, here 2 degrees C. If future emissions are optimally controlled, our ANS then suggests that current global well-being is sustainable. But if emissions remain uncontrolled, our base-case ANS is negative now and our corresponding, modified DICE model has an unsustained development path, with well-being peaking in 2065. Current ANS on an uncontrolled path may thus be a useful heuristic indicator of future unsustainability. Our inductive method might allow ANS to include other very hard-to-value, environmental threats to global sustainability, like biodiversity loss and nitrogen pollution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We statistically analyze the relationship between both industrial and non-industrial greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth and other potential drivers for 129 countries over the period from 1971 to 2010. Our analysis combines the three main approaches in the literature into a single framework for investigating the evolution of emissions and income. We find that economic growth is a driver of both industrial and non-industrial emissions, though economic growth has twice the effect on industrial emissions. The time effect is negative for both sources of emissions, though this effect is larger for non-industrial emissions. There is also convergence in emissions intensity for both types of emissions but given these other effects there is no evidence for an environmental Kuznets curve. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, paper aims at investigating the validity of the EKC hypothesis employing the dependent variable of CO2 emissions and regressors of GDP, quadratic GDP and renewable energy consumption. This paper, hence, analyzes this revisited EKC hypothesis to observe if (i) there exists an inverted-U shaped relationship between environmental quality (in terms of CO2 emissions), per capita income and per capita income squared and (ii) there exists a negative causality from renewables to CO2 emissions within EKC model. Paper employs a panel data set of 17 OECD countries over the period 1977-2010 and launches panel FMOLS and panel DOLS estimations. The findings support the EKC hypothesis for the panel and indicate that GDP per capita and GDP per capita squared have the impacts on CO2 emissions positively and negatively, respectively, and that renewable energy consumption yields negative impact on CO2 emissions. Another remark of this paper is that the validity of EKC does not depend on income level of individual countries of panel in which EKC hypothesis holds. Eventually, paper argues that if countries carry out (i) policies, i.e., for fair and easy access to the electricity from renewable sources and (ii) policies to increase renewables supply through i.e. improved renewable energy technologies, they will be able to contribute to combating global warming problem as they increase their GDP's.

To verify the capability of this framework to address China's economy, a key prediction of the GSM - the convergence in per capita CO2 emissions across Chinese provinces - is empirically verified. By assigning reasonable values to the GSM's key parameters, the trajectories of total CO2 emissions are projected for the three regions of China and the whole country. The forecast results show that, under the benchmark scenario, China's total CO2 emissions would peak around the year 2047. According to the sensitivity analysis, carbon efficiency is the most important determining factor for whether a turning point in total CO2 emissions may occur.},

  abstract = {The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) can be defined as a significant tool dedicated to explore the relationship between economic development and environment degradation. And EKC empirical studies usually confirm an inverted U-shaped relationship between some pollutants and per capita income. However, pollution load indicators seem insufficient to represent environmental quality comprehensively. Therefore, the empirical study of EKC for environmental quality, which confirms a U-shaped relationship has been conducted in Gansu province, China. What is more, time series econometric methodologies were used to take environmental quality as endogenous variable, and Bayesian methods were employed to deal with the trouble of overfitting problem. Based on the empirical data of Gansu province from 1980 to 2012, the cointegration equation derived from Bayesian VAR with Minnesota prior shows the optimal estimation. And the results have shown that the EKC for environmental quality in Gansu province was verified. It proved that it is possible for low-income economy to improve environmental quality rather than at the cost of being poorer. Technical effect and environmental regulations may play important roles for the decline of the curve. In addition, impulse response analysis indicates that the efforts to protect and restore environment means prospect of long-term earning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a mechanism explaining the surge in environmental culture across the globe. Based upon empirical evidence, we develop an overlapping generations model with environmental quality and endogenous environmental culture. Environmental culture may be costlessly transmitted intergenerationally, or via costly education. The model predicts that for low wealth levels, society is unable to free resources for environmental culture. In this case, society will only invest in environmental maintenance if environmental quality is sufficiently low. Once society has reached a certain level of economic development, then it may optimally invest a part of its wealth in developing an environmental culture. Environmental culture has not only a positive impact on environmental quality through lower levels of consumption, but it also improves the environment through maintenance expenditure for wealth-environment combinations at which, in a restricted model without environmental culture, no maintenance would be undertaken. Environmental culture leads to a society with a higher indirect utility at steady state in comparison to the restricted model. Our model leads us to the conclusion that, for societies trapped in a situation with low environmental quality, investments in culture may induce positive feedback loops, where more culture raises environmental quality which in turn raises environmental culture. We also discuss how environmental culture may lead to an Environmental Kuznets Curve. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

If residents engage in environmental protection activities, it then may be possible for environmentally based tourism economies to reach a smooth development process. The author shows that the (sustainable) balanced growth path is the only viable equilibrium, and along such a path consumption grows while environmental quality rises. Tourists' preferences crucially affect the long-run outcome, since economic and environmental growth rates increase with the green preference and decrease with the grey preference and crowding aversion parameters. Thus, if tourism specialization is to be the pathway to development, green tourism will need to be promoted.},

The model incorporates nonlinear effects, eventually heterogeneous across countries, for both income and time. We also handle serial correlation by using autoregressive moving average (ARMA) processes. We find that country-specific time related factors weight more than income in driving the northern EU Environmental Kuznets. Overall, the countries differ more on their carbon-time relation than on the carbon-income relation which is in almost all cases monotonic positive.

We also offer some policy simulations for the first and second regime, which illustrate that with a lower discount rate more oil is left in situ and renewables are phased in more quickly. We identify the conditions under which the optimal carbon tax rises or decreases. Subsidizing renewables (without a carbon tax) induces more oil to be left in situ and a quicker phasing in of renewables, but oil is depleted more rapidly initially.

  abstract = {I use a semiparametric smooth coefficient model to estimate a generalization of the emissions convergence models derived from the green Solow model proposed by Brock and Taylor (J Econ Growth 15:127-153, 2010). Parametric estimates of simple homogeneous coefficient convergence models suggest that there may be heterogeneity in emissions convergence across different subsamples of observations. The semiparametric models confirm that there is heterogeneity across countries in coefficient estimates; however, such heterogeneity does not appear to be substantial enough to qualitatively influence the estimates derived from the parametric models. Hence, I find that (i) the green Solow model is a robust framework for analyzing carbon emissions convergence and (ii) carbon emissions are converging across a large sample of countries. My results suggest that international agreements that assign pollution rights based on population levels may be agreeable to many nations.},

  abstract = {Since 1997, CO2 emissions have continued to rise in many countries despite their emission caps under the Kyoto Protocol (Kyoto). Failure to meet promised targets, however, does not imply that Kyoto has been pointless. Whether Kyoto has made a difference relative to the counterfactual of No Kyoto is an empirical question that requires an instrumental variables strategy. We argue that countries' ratification of the statutes governing the International Criminal Court is a valid instrument for ratification of Kyoto commitments. In our panel fixed effects estimations, the instrument easily passes weak identification and overidentification tests. It can be plausibly excluded from our second-stage equations and does not cause CO2 emissions. Our estimates suggest that Kyoto ratification has a quantitatively large (about 10 percent) and robust, though only moderately statistically significant, negative effect on CO2 emissions. We also show that higher fuel prices and a different energy mix in Kyoto countries support this result.},

Energy resource world markets are investigated as an offsetting mechanism possibly coordinating emission fluctuations between countries. The results of the analysis provide evidence that world energy resource markets are acting as a coordinating mechanism for emission fluctuations in most cases. The results also suggest that until recently the dominant emission co-fluctuation pattern for developed countries differs from the dominant emission co-fluctuation pattern for developing countries. The common fluctuation pattern found in the 1984-2000 time period suggests that an offsetting mechanism does exist and will help contain global per capita emissions into the future. The strong degree that emissions are linked between countries and energy markets acting as an offsetting mechanism suggests that to be successful a global agreement to address climate change must require emission reductions by all major emitters, not just the developed countries.

We do find that in coherence with their policy and economic commitment to carbon reductions and environmental market-based instruments implementation, bell shapes are present only for northern EU, which leads the group of advanced countries. The other two lag behind. We show for the first time that CKC shapes are present if we net out Europe of the southern and less developed countries. This is coherent with the Kuznets paradigm. The negative side of the tale is that they characterize a bunch of few countries. Other advanced countries lag behind and are far from reaching a CKC dynamics. Heterogeneous and Bayesian estimators clearly show this, with the EU presenting turning points closely around \$13?000 per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Heterogeneous panel estimates also show that for lagging countries presumed bell shapes turn into linear relationships. The stability of outcomes across models is stronger when we compare heterogeneous rather than homogeneous models. If it is compared with other studies, our analysis highlights a relative lower variability across specifications.},

First, evidence does not support theoretical models predicting the existence of a poverty-environment trap. Specifically, in the long-run two main groups of countries will emerge: poor versus polluting countries. Second, the typical development path leads initially to high emission levels and, subsequently, to high income. Third, the convergence process towards the stationary distribution is very slow. Finally, for carbon emissions, whenever it is observed, the environmental Kuznets curve seems to be only a transitory phenomenon.},

Estimates of the crucial parameters of the model using data from economies that display the EKC satisfy the theoretical indeterminacy condition. We find that the presence of abatement activities is not a necessary condition for indeterminacy equilibria and hence, an EKC to arise.

However, the literature on supply chain management has given little attention to the evolutionary complexity of the network structure and collaboration mechanism of CASNs. In this paper, we first model and simulate the evolution of CASNs based on complex adaptive system and fitness landscape theory. The simulation results indicate the evolutionary complexities such as emergence, quasi-equilibrium, chaos, and lock-in of CASNs. Then, a case study of the evolution of the LVEA (low voltage equipment apparatus) supply network in the emerging Chinese market has been explored to validate the findings from the simulation and develop a better understanding of the general principles influencing the emergence, adaptation and evolution of CASNs in the real world. Based on the simulation and the case study, we propose some propositions about the factors and principles influencing the evolutionary complexity of CASNs. The external environment factors and firm-internal mechanisms appear to be the dominant forces that shape the gradual evolution of CASNs. Factors in the external environment, such as government regulation, market demand and market structure appear to have a long-term impact on the evolution, while a firm's strategies, product structure, technology, and organization appear to be the internal factors that exert an immediate influence on the evolution of CASNs. Among these factors, cost and quality considerations appear to be the primary forces that influence the structure complexity, centralization, and formalization of CASNs.},

  abstract = {The economy is an adaptive and evolving complex system. The recognition of this fact has produced, over the last few years, a gradual but firm shift on the direction taken by mainstream economic thought. The representative agent paradigm is giving place to settings of interacting heterogeneous agents, capable of generating dynamic outcomes that are unique for each assumed pattern of interaction. The complexity era, as it is called, requires original insights and innovative approaches, in order to reinterpret the economic reality. This paper intends to contribute to the complexity literature in economics by exploring a popular macroeconomic model (the sticky-information model) from a new angle. Information acquisition by price-setting firms will be endogenously determined in two steps: (i) the competition between almost identical media leads to an irregular pattern of information creation; (ii) once created, information spreads throughout the interested audience following a diffusion process. The consequence is an erratic aggregate pattern of information acquisition that has consequences at a macro level, namely concerning the shape of the Phillips curve, which will change every period. Heterogeneity, self-organization, evolution, and out-of-equilibrium dynamics are features that allow to classify the suggested framework as a setting of macroeconomic complexity.},

  abstract = {Immediately after World War II the allied powers began what would be a slow march towards a worldwide economic and political order. They established an organization for political and military crises (the United Nations), economic rehabilitation (the International Monetary Fund), facilitation of capital transfers (the World Bank), and promotion of free trade among nations (the World Trade Organization). These organizations did, however, institute (or tried to institute) change from the top down, which reflected the prevailing philosophy of the time. The problem was and is that these organizations ignored inevitable change from the bottom up. The very fact of national sovereignty precluded a top down imposition of a world economic order. Instead, a peculiar interaction has been occurring between this top down rules and bottom up reactions that can best be explained through chaos, or complexity theory. These elements (both nations and international organizations) may be likened to individual units in social space. Each individual unit is influenced both by the surrounding units (i) and by factors in its immediate environment (e). The presence of self-reinforcing (feedback) behavior ensures reverse causality whereby the individual unit influences its environment, which in turn, influences the individual unit. In this system, the total number of inputs equals the total number of elements in the system (i + e) = N. In a binary system of this magnitude, where N is a large number like the WTO membership (W = 152 countries), chaos is likely to ensue. With nations and international organizations problems may come in two different ways. The first is when N $<$= 2, an ordered system emerges, because the elements have "low connectivity" to inputs. In this, the system withstands small perturbations and returns shortly to its original attractors; this homeostatic property also implies that significant behavioral (or permanent) changes can be achieved only by the introduction of major perturbations in the system. In the same vein, in a system with "high connectivity" order can also emerge if there exist biased "Boolean Switching Rules". The current movement to worldwide economic order represents the introduction of specific "point attractors" to bring nations into global equilibrium. Unfortunately, these attractors are being introduced from the "top-down" by the wealthiest nations of the world. Hence, despite the presence of such "point attractors" as outlined above, the top-down approach also has the effect of incorporating strange attractors from the local systems. This paper discusses the adaptive complexity of designing and implementing world governance rules to sustain the survival and growth of the WTO. The paper utilizes the methodologies of "adaptive complex systems" and "evolutionary economics" and highlights its arguments by employing clinical studies from the U.S.A. Latin America, and Africa.},

(2005 Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 56, 489-512). The CATS model has been extensively used to replicate a large number of scaling types stylized facts with a remarkable degree of precision. For such purposes, the simulation of the model has been performed entering ad hoc parameter values and using the same initial set up for all the agents involved in the experiments. Nowadays alternative robust and reliable validation techniques for determining whether the simulation model is an acceptable representation of the real system are available. Moreover many distributional and goodness-of-fit tests have been developed while several graphical tools have been proposed to give the researcher a quick comprehension of actual and simulated data. This paper discusses some validation experiments performed with the modified CATS model. In particular starting from a sample of Italian firms included in the CEBI database, we perform several ex-post validation experiments over the simulation period 1982-2000. In the experiments, the model parameters have been estimated using actual data and the initial set up consists of a sample of agents in 1982. The CATS model is then simulated over the period 1982-2000. Using alternative validation techniques, the simulations' results are ex-post validated with respect to the actual data. The results are promising in that they show the good capabilities of the CATS model in reproducing the observed reality. Finally we have performed a first calibration experiment via indirect inference, in order to ameliorate our estimates. Even in this case, the results are interesting.},

  abstract = {Whereas our understanding of corporate entrepreneurship (CE) and corporate entrepreneurship strategy (CES) continues to expand, there has been little theoretical development to support the most extensive framework to date: the integrative model of CES as proposed by Ireland et al. (Entrep Theory Pract 33(1):19-46, 2009). According to the model, CES is built upon the "three foundational elements of an entrepreneurial strategic vision, a pro-entrepreneurship organizational architecture, and entrepreneurial processes and behaviors as exhibited throughout the organization" (Ireland et al. 2009, p. 38). The purpose of this study is to present a broad, overarching theory--complexity science--to examine the key elements and propositions of the CES model. Complexity science--founded on assumptions of interdependent heterogeneous agents and nonlinear interactions, as well as non-deterministic and potentially extreme outcomes--offers established multi-level concepts, theoretical boundary conditions, and methodological guidance for scholars to build and test future studies on CE and CES. Though our complexity perspective draws extensively from conceptual work on complex adaptive systems and agent-based models, we ground our arguments on the empirical ubiquity of power law distributions in all constructs and levels of analysis within the CES model. We conclude with a detailed research agenda, as well as a prescriptive discussion related to theory development, quantitative analysis, and practical applications to guide future studies on CE.},

  abstract = {'This book puts human beings back at the heart of the economic process. It shows how this classical, human-centred tradition, stretching from Adam Smith onward, gives us a much better understanding of economic events - and what to do about them - than the mechanistic, mathematical models of too many economists and planners today.'- Eamonn Butler, The Adam Smith Institute, UK'David Simpson writes about key economic issues with admirable lucidity. He draws deeply on experience as well as on his knowledge of economic theory.'- Asa BriggsDavid Simpson skilfully argues that a market economy can be best understood as a human complex system, a perspective that represents a continuation of the classical tradition in economic thought. In the classical tradition, growth rather than allocative efficiency is the principal object of enquiry, economic phenomena are recognised to be elements of processes rather than structures, and change is evolutionary.The book shows the common principles that connect the early classical school, the Austrian school and complexity theory in a single line of thought. It goes on to show how these principles can be applied to explain the characteristic features of a market economy - namely incessant change, growth, the business cycle and the market process itself - and argues that static equilibrium theory, whether neoclassical or neo-Keynesian, cannot satisfactorily account for these phenomena.This fascinating book will provide a stimulating read for academics, postgraduate students and all those with an interest in economic theory and economic policy.Contents: Preface 1.

  abstract = {Much is written in the popular literature about the current pace of technological change. But do we have enough scientific knowledge about the sources and management of innovation to properly inform policymaking in technology dependent domains such as energy and the environment? While it is agreed that technological change does not 'fall from heaven like autumn leaves,' the theory, data, and models are deficient. The specific mechanisms that govern the rate and direction of inventive activity, the drivers and scope for incremental improvements that occur during technology diffusion, and the spillover effects that cross-fertilize technological innovations remain poorly understood.  In a work that will interest serious readers of history, policy, and economics, the editors and their distinguished contributors offer a unique, single volume overview of the theoretical and empirical work on technological change. Beginning with a survey of existing research, they provide analysis and case studies in contexts such as medicine, agriculture, and power generation, paying particular attention to what technological change means for efficiency, productivity, and reduced environmental impacts. The book includes a historical analysis of technological change, an examination of the overall direction of technological change, and general theories about the sources of change. The contributors empirically test hypotheses of induced innovation and theories of institutional innovation. They propose ways to model induced technological change and evaluate its impact, and they consider issues such as uncertainty in technology returns, technology crossover effects, and clustering.

Unable to import either food or the farm chemicals and machines needed to grow it via conventional agriculture, Cuba turned inward toward self-reliance. Sustainable agriculture, organic farming, urban gardens, smaller farms, animal traction and biological pest control are part of the successful paradigm shift underway in the Cuban countryside. In this book Cuban authors offer details for the first time in Englishof these remarkable achievements, which may serve as guideposts toward healthier, more environmentally friendly and self-reliant farming in countries both North and South.},

This paper links dynamic overlapping-generations and microsimulation models of the United States to estimate the initial incidence of a carbon tax across states. Geographic differences in incidence are driven primarily by differences in sources of income. Differing patterns of energy use also matter but are relatively less important. The use of the carbon tax revenue plays an important role, particularly in determining how different income sources are affected, as (1) using carbon tax revenue to cut capital taxes disproportionately benefits states with large shares of capital income; (2) returning the revenue via lump-sum transfers favors relatively low-income states; and (3) returning the revenue via cuts in labor taxes provides a relatively even distribution of cost across states. In general, geographic differences in incidence are substantially smaller than the differences across income groups.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the effects of a U.S. carbon tax on U.S. industries. We consider alternative tax designs that differ according to the tax treatment of internationally traded goods and the use of tax revenues. The effects of these policy options are explored with a dynamic general equilibrium model of the United States that incorporates international trade. In general, the burden of a U.S. carbon tax is fairly highly concentrated among a few industries. For these industries, the magnitude of the burden depends critically on the way the tax is designed. The costs to these industries in terms of profits and output are much lower when the tax is introduced on a destination basis (i.e., based on carbon emissions associated with the consumption or use of fuels) than when it is introduced on an origin basis (i.e., based on emissions associated with the production or supply of fuels). On the other hand, for a given tax rate the economy-wide costa are higher when the tax is destination-based, reflecting the fact that the nation's "emissions consumption" exceeds its "emissions production." There are various degrees to which policy makers could implement the destination principle in a carbon tax. This choice critically influences the extent to which the tax preserves "international competitiveness" as well as the administrative feasibility of the tax. One option is to apply the destination principle selectively, imposing the tax on the limited number of carbon-based products with "significant" carbon content. This gives rise to a partial destination-based tax. Such a tax would avert the most serious potential costs in terms of international competitiveness while avoiding the substantial administrative costs that a full destination-based carbon tax could entail. At the same time, the partial destination-based tax could achieve over 90 percent of the reduction in U.S.-consumption-related emissions that would occur under the full destination-based tax. Using carbon tax revenues to finance cuts in pre-existing distortionary taxes reduces, but does not eliminate, the adverse consequences of the carbon tax policy for industry profits and investment. Aggregate efficiency results suggest that a carbon tax must inevitably generate losses to at least some industries.},

  abstract = {Cities consume 80\% of the world's energy; therefore, analyzing urban energy metabolism and the resulting carbon footprint provides basic data for formulating target carbon emission reductions. While energy metabolism includes both direct and indirect consumptions among sectors, few researchers have studied indirect consumption due to a lack of data. In this study, we used input-output analysis to calculate the energy flows among directly linked sectors. Building on this, we used ecological network analysis to develop a model of urban energy flows and also account for energy consumption embodied by the flows among indirectly linked sectors (represented numerically as paths with a length of 2 or more). To illustrate the model, monetary input-output tables for Beijing from 2000 to 2010 were analyzed to determine the embodied energy consumption and associated carbon footprints of these sectors. This analysis reveals the environmental pressure based on the source (energy consumption) and sink (carbon footprint) values. Indirect consumption was Beijing's primary form, and the carbon footprint therefore resulted mainly from indirect consumption (both accounting for ca. 60\% of the total, though with considerable variation among sectors). To reduce emissions, the utilization efficiency of indirect consumption must improve.},

  abstract = {Life Cycle Inventory analysis (LCI) is defined as a phase of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) involving the compilation and quantification of inputs and outputs for a given product system throughout its life cycle (ISO 14040 1998a). The concept of LCI has been adopted for cleaner production as early as the 1960s, and has had broad industrial and academic application in the last decades (Vigon et al. 1993). Com pared to the other phases of LCA, LCI has been considered a rather straightforward procedure except for several issues such as allocation (see e.g. Fava et al. 1991). Reflecting this belief, the method used for LCI compilation has rarely been questioned, although a large number of software, LCI databases and case studies have been released so far. However, contrary to the common belief, different methods have been available for LCI, and they often generate significantly different results. Therefore, it is necessary to assess advantages and limitations of different LCI methods and properly select suitable one(s) for each specific application. It is the aim of this paper to review and compare available methods for LCI compilation, and guide LCA users to properly select the most relevant methods for their analyses in relation to the goal and scope of the study as well as the resources and time available. With adaptations, the results are applicable outside the realm of LCA as well. This paper is organized as follows: first available methods of LCI compilation are presented. Two computational approaches, process flow diagram and matrix inversion, are assessed, and then methods that utilize economic Input-Output Analysis (IOA) are described with special attention to hybrid analyses. Secondly, these methods are summarized and compared in terms of data requirements, uncertainty of source data, upstream system boundary, technological system boundary, geographical system boundary, available analytical tools, time and labor intensity, simplicity of application, required computational tools and available software tools. Finally, conclusions are drawn, and compliance of these methods to ISO standards and future outlooks are discussed.},

However, it has relied on models that provide a limited description of energy flows in the economic system and do not allow an adequate analysis of energy efficiency. This paper introduces a novel energy input\textendash{}output model, the multi-factor energy input\textendash{}output model (MF-EIO model), which is obtained from a partitioning of a hybrid-unit input\textendash{}output system of the economy. This model improves on current models by describing the energy flows according to the processes of energy conversion and the levels of energy use in the economy. It characterizes the vector of total energy output as a function of seven factors: two energy efficiency indicators; two characteristics of end-use energy consumption; and three economic features of the rest of the economy. Moreover, it is consistent with the standard model for EIO analysis, i.e., the hybrid-unit model. This paper also introduces an approximate version of the MF-EIO model, which is equivalent to the former under equal energy prices for industries and final consumers, but requires less data processing. The latter is composed by two linked models: a model of the energy sector in physical units, and a model of the rest of the economy in monetary units. In conclusion, the proposed modelling framework improves EIO analysis and extends EIO applications to the accounting for energy efficiency of the economy.},

  abstract = {Global commodity trade networks are critical to our collective sustainable development. Their increasing interconnectedness pose two practical questions: (i) Do the current network configurations support their further growth? (ii) How resilient are these networks to economic shocks? We analyze the data of global commodity trade flows from 1996 to 2012 to evaluate the relationship between structural properties of the global commodity trade networks and (a) their dynamic growth, as well as (b) the resilience of their growth with respect to the 2009 global economic shock. Specifically, we explore the role of network efficiency and redundancy using the information theory-based network flow analysis. We find that, while network efficiency is positively correlated with growth, highly efficient systems appear to be less resilient, losing more and gaining less growth following an economic shock. While all examined networks are rather redundant, we find that network redundancy does not hinder their growth. Moreover, systems exhibiting higher levels of redundancy lose less and gain more growth following an economic shock. We suggest that a strategy to support making global trade networks more efficient via, e.g., preferential trade agreements and higher specialization, can promote their further growth; while a strategy to increase the global trade networks' redundancy via e.g., more abundant free-trade agreements, can improve their resilience to global economic shocks.},

The inter-country energy trade reallocates the energy resources and sustains economic development, which is crucial to global energy supply and security. To investigate the structural features of the inter-country energy trade markets, we built the inter-country energy trade network covering 40 representatives based on the input\textendash{}output table and ecological network analysis (ENA). The indicator of control difference is used to explore the relationship between countries within the global energy supply market. The results show that Canada, Latvia, Malta and Poland are the main exporters, and the Japan, Germany, Korea, Turkey and Mexico are main importers. According to the dependence results, such as Japan has strong dependence on Canada, Korea is highly dependent on the Malta can provide insights for how to improve countries' security by adjusting the energy trade policies.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the changing structure of the United States' (U.S.) domestic economy by applying information theory-based metrics to the U.S. input\textendash{}output (I\textendash{}O) tables from 1947 to 2012. Here the I\textendash{}O tables are an economic network where the sectors are the nodes. The value of these metrics is that they describe the balance or trade-off between efficiency and redundancy of network flows as well as equality and hierarchy of flows through nodes in a network. I relate these metrics to the U.S. gross power consumption and annual intermediate spending by the food and energy sectors, the latter being a proxy for the inverse of the net power ratio (or net energy) of the economy, to test hypotheses of energy\textendash{}economy structural linkages. The results of this paper show that increasing gross power consumption, as well as a decreasing share of intermediate expenditures of the food and energy sectors, correlates with increased distribution of money among economic sectors, and vice versa. The information theory metrics indicate two time periods at which major structural shifts occurred. The first was between 1967 and 1972, and the second was around the turn of the twenty-first century when food and energy expenditures no longer continued to decrease after 2002. In response to the latter, it is clear that the U.S. economy did trade off structural reserves (e.g., decreasing metrics of conditional entropy, redundancy, and equality) for structural efficiency (e.g., increasing metrics of efficiency, mutual constraint, and hierarchy) after food and energy expenditures increased post-2002. I also test the structural trends with increasingly simpler (e.g., fewer sectors) representations of the I\textendash{}O tables, and the results are more consistent for I\textendash{}O representations that account for inputs and outputs (e.g., value added and gross domestic product) rather than only the intermediate transactions among sectors. The findings of this paper have important implications for economic modeling in at least two ways. First, the paper helps explain how fundamental shifts in resources costs relate to economic structure and economic growth. Second, the paper shows that the number of sectors used to represent economic transactions influences the systemic metrics themselves.},

It is easy to identify the number of roles in a linear or cyclic unweighted network. There is only one logically consistent way to generalize the measures of nodes, flows, connectivity, and roles into weighted networks, and these generalizations are equivalent to indices derived from information theory and used by ecologists since the late seventies. Data from ecosystem networks suggests that ecosystems inhabit a narrow window of the parameter space defined by these measures. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Mere counts of ecosystem species and transfers have not much illumined the issue, in part because magnitudes of trophic transfers vary by orders of magnitude in power-law fashion. We address this issue by creating a suite of measures that extend the basic indexes usually obtained by counting taxa and transfers so as to apply to networks wherein magnitudes vary by orders of magnitude. Application of the extended measures to data on ecosystem trophic networks reveals that the actual complexity of ecosystem webs is far less than usually imagined, because most ecosystem networks consist of a multitude of weak connections dominated by a relatively few strong flows. Although quantitative ecosystem networks may consist of hundreds of nodes and thousands of transfers, they nevertheless behave similarly to simpler representations of systems with fewer than 14 nodes or 40 flows. Both theory and empirical data point to an upper bound on the number of effective trophic levels at about 3\textendash{}4 links. We suggest that several whole-system processes may be at play in generating these ecosystem limits and regularities.},

It explains the skewness, and the existence of rare but violent explosions in prices, coupled with a high degree of price autocorrelation in more normal times. A central feature of the model is the explicit recognition of the fact that it is impossible for the market as a whole to carry negative inventories, and this introduces an essential non-linearity which carries through into non-linearity of the predicted commodity price series. For most of the thirteen commodity prices, the behaviour of prices from one year to the next conforms to the predictions of the theory about conditional expectations and conditional variances. However, given the non-linearity both of the model and of the actual prices, such conformity is not enough to ensure that the theory yields a complete account of the data. In particular, the analysis does not yield a fully satisfactory explanation for the high autocorrelation observed in the data.},

The approach is based on the application of the Linear Expenditure System (LES) to each of a range of household income groups, rather than being based on a "representative" consumer. The method is then used to examine the distributional effects of a carbon tax, designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The price changes resulting from a carbon tax depend on the "carbon intensities" of each good, which depend in turn on the nature of inter-industry transactions (the input-output matrix). The use of transfer payments to compensate for adverse distributional effects of a carbon tax is investigated, using social welfare functions based on equivalent incomes.},

The use of agricultural endowments specifically the abundance of land suitable for growing wheat relative to that suitable for growing sugarcane as an instrument for inequality is this paper's approach to problems of measurement and endogeneity of inequality. The paper finds inequality also affects other development outcomes - institutions and schooling which the literature has emphasized as mechanisms by which higher inequality lowers per capita income. It tests the inequality hypothesis for development, institutional quality and schooling against other recent hypotheses in the literature. While finding some evidence consistent with other development fundamentals, the paper finds high inequality to independently be a large and statistically significant barrier to prosperity, good quality institutions, and high schooling.

This article stems from the idea of investigating how decision-makers, abandoning their traditional economic models and focusing on innovative components of evolutionary economics instead, can achieve better performance results in organizing and optimizing an economic system based on fiscal federalism. For this purpose, fiscal federalism must be understood as a dense network of economic relationships between different complex adaptive and co-evolving systems, the jurisdictions, linked by strong interdependencies. A better understanding of the links between interdependence will be provided by Stuart Kauffman's NK model. The relevance of the NK model in the study of economic organizations has been noted in the relevant literature. This literature, however, neglects the problem of co-evolution, which underpins our article.},

  abstract = {It is indisputable that modern life is enabled by the use of materials in its technologies. Those technologies do many things very well, largely because each material is used for purposes to which it is exquisitely fitted. The result over time has been a steady increase in product performance. We show that this materials complexity has markedly increased in the past half-century and that elemental life cycle analyses characterize rates of recycling and loss. A further concern is that of possible scarcity of some of the elements as their use increases. Should materials availability constraints occur, the use of substitute materials comes to mind. We studied substitution potential by generating a comprehensive summary of potential substitutes for 62 different metals in all their major uses and of the performance of the substitutes in those applications. As we show herein, for a dozen different metals, the potential substitutes for their major uses are either inadequate or appear not to exist at all. Further, for not 1 of the 62 metals are exemplary substitutes available for all major uses. This situation largely decouples materials substitution from price, thereby forcing material design changes to be primarily transformative rather than incremental. As wealth and population increase worldwide in the next few decades, scientists will be increasingly challenged to maintain and improve product utility by designing new and better materials, but doing so under potential constraints in resource availability.},

Although simple, the model can reproduce a lot of the stylized facts of business cycles. The author argues that agent-based modeling is an adequate response to the recently expressed criticism of macroeconomic methodology because it allows for aggregate behavior that is more than simply a replication of microeconomic optimization decisions in equilibrium. At the same time, it allows for absolutely consistent microfoundations, including the structure and properties of markets. Most importantly, it does not depend on equilibrium assumptions or fictitious auctioneers and does therefore not rule out coordination failures, instability, and crisis by definition. A situation that is very close to a general equilibrium can instead be shown to result endogenously from non-rational micro interaction.},

In the system model of autocatalytic growth we introduce endogenous and exogenous variables that provide negative feedbacks to material growth and push the economic system into the mature stage of development. Based on general developmental stages for dissipative systems, we identify variables that would uniquely mark the transition to maturity: p.c. energy consumption, GDP and energy consumption distribution, and sector composition of labor and GDP. Empirical findings suggest that the observed groups of economies may have terminated their historic phase of intensive economic growth and are entering the mature stage. This provides a tentative explanation of the observed slow-down of long-run rates of GDP growth in the G7 economies and in Western Europe.},

  abstract = {This article reviews software platforms for scientific agent-based models (ABMs), by implementing example models in each platform. NetLogo is the highest-level platform, providing a simple yet powerful programming language, built-in graphical interfaces, and comprehensive documentation. It is designed primarily for ABMs of mobile individuals in a grid space with local interactions, but not necessarily clumsy for others. NetLogo is highly recommended, even for prototyping complex models. MASON, Repast, and Swarm are "framework and library" platforms, providing a conceptual framework for organizing and designing ABMs and corresponding software libraries. MASON is least mature and designed with execution speed a high priority. The Objective-C version of Swarm is the most mature library platform and is stable and well-organized. Objective-C seems more natural for ABMs than Java, but weak error-handling and the lack of developer tools are drawbacks. Java Swarm allows Swarm's Objective-C libraries to be called from Java; it does not seem to combine the advantages of the two languages well. Repast provides Swarm-like functions in a Java library and is a good choice for many, but parts of its organization and design could be improved. A rough comparison of execution speed found MASON and Repast fastest (MASON 1-35\% faster than Repast), Swarm (including Objective-C) sometimes fastest and sometimes slowest, and NetLogo intermediate. Recommendations include providing basic documentation (a weakness of all platforms except NetLogo), strengthening conceptual frameworks, providing better tools for statistical output and automating simulation experiments, simplifying common tasks, and researching technologies for understanding simulation results and how they arise.},

  abstract = {Industrialized society will transition away from dependence on non-renewable resources (fossil fuels, in particular) sometime in the foreseeable future. How disruptive this transition will be to the economy and societal well-being is unknown, particularly if there are any sudden resource supply constraints. However, the effects of resource supply constraints on an economy, or models of the interdependent relationship between the economy and natural capital overall have not been thoroughly developed. One problem is that traditional models of the economy assume linear growth, while highly interdependent industrialized economies may behave more like a complex adaptive system with non-linear, path-dependent, and unexpected growth trajectories. Agent-based models have been shown to successfully model important aspects of a complex adaptive economy. This paper uses an agent-based model to demonstrate potential economic impacts for industrialized economies in the face of a sudden resource supply constraint. Economic ``agents'' mine resources and invent technology. Through trade and specialization, the economy evolves from a collection of self-sustaining, resource-poor agents to a society with a high degree of interdependence and wealth. Economic growth, however, comes with a cost; the interdependence that arises from specialization and trade also leads to a less resilient economy. Unexpected, large economic collapse can arise from a shock to even a single resource, due to each resource's interdependent role in the economy.},

The role of entropy maximizing in geography, and more widely in complexity science, is reviewed and two conclusions are drawn beyond the continued effective deployment of entropy models: geography could be a leading player as complexity science develops; and geography can use these ideas to update the presentation of its classic theories.

As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them. Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity.},

The authors of The Atlas of Economic Complexity offer readers an explanation based on "Economic Complexity," a measure of a society's productive knowledge. Prosperous societies are those that have the knowledge to make a larger variety of more complex products.  The Atlas of Economic Complexity attempts to measure the amount of productive knowledge countries hold and how they can move to accumulate more of it by making more complex products.Through the graphical representation of the "Product Space," the authors are able to identify each country's "adjacent possible," or potential new products, making it easier to find paths to economic diversification and growth. In addition, they argue that a country's economic complexity and its position in the product space are better predictors of economic growth than many other well-known development indicators, including measures of competitiveness, governance, finance, and schooling.Using innovative visualizations, the book locates each country in the product space, provides complexity and growth potential rankings for 128 countries, and offers individual country pages with detailed information about a country's current capabilities and its diversification options. The maps and visualizations included in the Atlas can be used to find more viable paths to greater productive knowledge and prosperity.},

  abstract = {The Poor People's Campaign of 1968 has long been overshadowed by the assassination of its architect, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the political turmoil of that year. In a major reinterpretation of civil rights and Chicano movement history, Gordon K. Mantler demonstrates how King's unfinished crusade became the era's most high-profile attempt at multiracial collaboration and sheds light on the interdependent relationship between racial identity and political coalition among African Americans and Mexican Americans. Mantler argues that while the fight against poverty held great potential for black-brown cooperation, such efforts also exposed the complex dynamics between the nation's two largest minority groups. Drawing on oral histories, archives, periodicals, and FBI surveillance files, Mantler paints a rich portrait of the campaign and the larger antipoverty work from which it emerged, including the labor activism of Cesar Chavez, opposition of Black and Chicano Power to state violence in Chicago and Denver, and advocacy for Mexican American land-grant rights in New Mexico. Ultimately, Mantler challenges readers to rethink the multiracial history of the long civil rights movement and the difficulty of sustaining political coalitions.},
