  title = {The {{Changing Structure}} of {{Global Value Chains}}: {{Are Central Hubs Key}} for {{Productivity}}?},
  abstract = {This article uses ``centrality'' metrics reflecting position within Global Value Chains (GVCs) to identify central hubs and peripheral European economies and sectors. We find evidence of large changes in the structure of European production networks, with rising importance of Eastern European economies coinciding with the timing of their EU accession. Using cross-country firm-level data from ORBIS, we find that changing structure of GVCs can play a role in the catchup of firms, but the effects are heterogeneous across firms and countries. First, becoming more central is associated with faster productivity growth of firms in post-2004 EU members. Second, the average productivity (centrality weighted) of buyers/suppliers matters for the productivity of firms overall in other European economies, and particularly non-frontier (initially less productive) firms in both groups of countries. The results for post-2004 EU members suggest that policies to encourage integration into GVCs are particularly important for the productivity of emerging or less integrated economies, whereas for more advanced economies a more sophisticated policy is needed that encourages the formation of linkages with productive, frontier foreign firms and economies.},

  abstract = {Trade networks, across which countries distribute their products, are crucial components of the globalized world economy. Their structure affects the mechanism of propagation of shocks from country to country, as observed in a very sharp way in the past decade, characterized by economic uncertainty in many parts of the world. Such trade structures are strongly heterogeneous across products, given the different features of the countries which buy and sell goods. By using a diversified pool of indicators from network science and product complexity theory, we quantitatively demonstrate that, overall, products with higher complexity\textemdash{}i.e., with larger technological content and/or number of components\textemdash{}are traded through more centralized networks\textemdash{}i.e., with a smaller number of countries concentrating most of the export flow. Since centralized networks are known to be more vulnerable, we argue that the current composition of production and trading is associated to high fragility at the level of the most complex\textemdash{}thus strategic\textemdash{}products.},

Using a multi-sector general equilibrium model, we show that the interplay of idiosyncratic microeconomic shocks and sectoral heterogeneity results in systematic departures in the likelihood of large economic downturns relative to what is implied by the normal distribution. Notably, we also show that such departures can happen while GDP is approximately normally distributed away from the tails, highlighting the qualitatively different behavior of large economic downturns from small or moderate fluctuations. We further demonstrate the special role that input-output linkages play in generating ``tail comovements,'' whereby large recessions involve not only significant GDP contractions, but also large simultaneous declines across a wide range of sectors.},

We document that the disruption caused by the earthquake and its aftermaths propagated upstream and downstream supply chains, affecting the direct and indirect suppliers and customers of disaster-stricken firms. We then use our empirical findings to obtain an estimate for the overall macroeconomic impact of the shock by taking these propagation effects into account. We find that the propagation of the shock over input-output linkages can account for a 1.2 percentage point decline in Japan's gross output in the year following the earthquake. We interpret these findings in the context of a general equilibrium model that takes the firm-to-firm linkages into account explicitly.},

We set up a simple multi-sector model of heterogeneous firms selling to multiple markets to motivate a theoretically-founded decomposition of firms' annual sales growth rate into different components. We find that the firm-specific component contributes substantially to aggregate sales volatility, mattering about as much as the components capturing shocks that are common across firms within a sector or country. We then decompose the firm-specific component to provide evidence on two mechanisms that generate aggregate fluctuations from microeconomic shocks highlighted in the recent literature: (i) when the firm size distribution is fat-tailed, idiosyncratic shocks to large firms directly contribute to aggregate fluctuations; and (ii) aggregate fluctuations can arise from idiosyncratic shocks due to input-output linkages across the economy. Firm linkages are approximately three times as important as the direct effect of firm shocks in driving aggregate fluctuations.},

The equilibria have a simple probabilistic structure that demonstrates how local interactions can affect the aggregate equilibrium.

This paper sets out to identify the linkages between these phenomena. It shows that GVC participation has a small effect on the distribution of wages and, when it has, it can reduce wage inequality when it concerns participation related to low-skilled segments of the labour force. This suggests that the potential tensions between equity and aggregate economic outcomes of GVC participation hold only in particular cases, namely when participation relates to high-skilled segments of the labour force. For policy-makers seeking to maximise the benefits of GVC participation, questions of a more equitable distribution of returns to workers might focus on skill-upgrading of low-skilled labour by promoting further tertiary education and development of skills.},

  abstract = {Growing interest in inequality has generated an outpouring of scholarly research and has brought many discussions on the subject into the public realm. Surprisingly, most of these studies and discussions rely on a narrow set of indicators to measure inequality. Most of the time a single summary measure of inequality is considered: the Gini coefficient. This is surprising not only because there are many ways to measure inequality, but mostly because the Gini coefficient has only limited success in its ability to generate the amount and type of data required to analyze the complex patterns and dynamics of inequality within and across countries. Often, in defense of the use of the Gini coefficient, it is argued that this popular indicator has a readily intuitive interpretation. While from a formal point of view most measures of inequality are closely interrelated, at an intuitive level this interrelationship is rarely highlighted. This paper suggests an intuitive interpretation for the Theil index, a measure of inequality with unique properties that makes it a powerful instrument to produce data and to analyze patterns and dynamics of inequality. Since the potential of the Theil index to generate rich data sets has been analyzed elsewhere (Concei{\c c}\~ao and Galbraith, 1998), here we will focus on the intuitive interpretation of the Theil index and on its potential for analytical work. The discussion will be accompanied throughout with empirical applications, and concludes with the description of a simple software application that can be used to compute the Theil index at different levels of aggregation of the individuals that compose the distribution.},

Our main results provide a characterization of this relationship in terms of the importance of different sectors as suppliers to their immediate customers, as well as their role as indirect suppliers to chains of downstream sectors. Such higher-order interconnections capture the possibility of "cascade effects" whereby productivity shocks to a sector propagate not only to its immediate downstream customers, but also to the rest of the economy. Our results highlight that sizable aggregate volatility is obtained from sectoral idiosyncratic shocks only if there exists significant asymmetry in the roles that sectors play as suppliers to others, and that the "sparseness" of the input\textemdash{}output matrix is unrelated to the nature of aggregate fluctuations.},

We first exposit that in the presence of Cobb-Douglas production functions and consumer preferences, there is a specific pattern of economic transmission whereby demand-side shocks propagate upstream (to input-supplying industries) and supply-side shocks propagate downstream (to customer industries) and that there is a tight relationship between the direct impact of a shock and the magnitudes of the downstream and the upstream indirect effects. We then investigate the short-run propagation of four different types of industry-level shocks: two demand-side ones (the exogenous component of the variation in industry imports from China and changes in federal spending) and two supply-side ones (TFP shocks and variation in knowledge/ideas coming from foreign patenting). In each case, we find substantial propagation of these shocks through the input-output network, with a pattern broadly consistent with theory. Quantitatively, the networkbased propagation is larger than the direct effects of the shocks. We also show quantitatively large effects from the geographic network, capturing the fact that the local propagation of a shock to an industry will fall more heavily on other industries that tend to collocate with it across local markets. Our results suggest that the transmission of various different types of shocks through economic networks and industry interlinkages could have first-order implications for the macroeconomy.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper argues that factor demand linkages can be important for the transmission of both sectoral and aggregate shocks. We show this using a panel of highly disaggregated manufacturing sectors together with sectoral structural VARs. When sectoral interactions are explicitly accounted for, a contemporaneous technology shock to all manufacturing sectors implies a positive response in both output and hours at the aggregate level. Otherwise there is a negative correlation, as in much of the existing literature. Furthermore, we find that technology shocks are important drivers of the business cycle.},

  abstract = {Applying network science concepts and methods to economic systems is not a new idea. In the last few decades, however, advances in non-equilibrium thermodynamics (i.e., self-organizing, open, dissipative, far-from-equilibrium systems), and nonlinear dynamics, network science, information theory, and other mathematical approaches to complex systems have produced a new set of concepts and methods, which are powerful for understanding and predicting behavior in socio-economic systems. In several previous papers, for example, we used research from the new Energy Network Science (ENS) to show how and why systemic ecological and economic health requires a balance of efficiency and resilience be maintained within a particular a ``window of vitality''. The current paper outlines the logic behind 10 principles of systemic, socio-economic health and the quantitative measures that go with them. Our particular focus is on ``regenerative aspects'', i.e., the self-feeding, self-renewal, and adaptive learning processes that natural systems use to nourish their capacity to thrive for long periods of time. In socioeconomic systems, we demonstrate how regenerative economics requires regular investment in human, social, natural, and physical capital. Taken as a whole, we propose these 10 metrics represent a new capacity to understand, and set better policy for solving, the entangled systemic suite of social, environmental, and economic problems now faced in industrial cultures.},

They all spring from a common family that are characterized by the same axioms. In particular, they are all based on a additively separable and linear treatment of a statistic that captures a node's position in the network. Using such statistics on nodes' positions, we also characterize networks on which centrality measures all agree.},

We study the main borrower role of Demirbank in the crash of the banking system with network centrality measures which are extensively used in the network theory. This ex-post analysis of the crisis shows that centrality measures perform well in identifying and monitoring systemically important financial institutions which provides useful insights for financial regulations.},

  title = {Financial {{Centrality}} and the {{Value}} of {{Key Players}}},
  abstract = {Consider an economy in which agents face endowment income risk but have stochastic market access as they interact in a stochastic financial network. We define the financial centrality of an agent as the ex-ante marginal social value of injecting an infinitesimal amount of liquidity to that agent. We show financially central agents are not only those who trade often, but those who have fewer trading links with other agents given this frequency, trade when income risk is high, when income shocks are positively correlated, when attitudes toward risk are more sensitive in the aggregate, and when there are tail risks. Equivalently, financial centrality is the value of a personalized security which pays off over states in which a named trader participates in market exchanges. Evidence from village risk-sharing network data in which the Pareto weights of the model are determined from bargaining solutions is consistent with theory. We allow for endogenous market participation and conclude with normative, policy implications.},

  title = {Systemic {{Risk}} and {{Network Formation}} in the {{Interbank Market}}},
  abstract = {We propose a novel mechanism to facilitate understanding of systemic risk in financial markets. The literature on systemic risk has focused on two mechanisms, common shocks and domino-like sequential default. Our approach is a formal model that provides an intellectual combination of the two by looking at how shocks propagate through a network of interconnected banks. Transmission in our model is not based on default. Instead, we provide a simple microfoundation of banks' profitability based on classic competition incentives. As competitors lending quantities change, both for closely connected ones and the whole market, banks adjust their own lending decisions as a result, generating a `transmission' of shocks through the system. We provide a unique equilibrium characterization of a static model, and embed this model into a full dynamic model of network formation with n agents. Because we have an explicit characterization of equilibrium behavior, we have a tractable way to bring the model to the data. Indeed, our measures of systemic risk capture the propagation of shocks in a wide variety of contexts; that is, it can explain the pattern of behavior both in good times as well as in crisis.},

The chapter then discusses informational contagion, understood as the process whereby a shock to one market is transmitted to other markets via the information revealed in the first market.},

  url = {http://www.nber.org/papers/w24270},
  abstract = {Since 1965, average idiosyncratic risk (IR) has never been lower than in recent years. In contrast to the high IR in the late 1990s that has drawn considerable attention in the literature, average market-model IR is 44\% lower in 2013-2017 than in 1996-2000. Macroeconomic variables help explain why IR is lower, but using only macroeconomic variables leads to large prediction errors compared to using only firm-level variables. As a result of the dramatic change in the number and composition of listed firms since the late 1990s, listed firms are larger and older. Larger and older firms have lower idiosyncratic risk. Models that use firm characteristics to predict firm-level idiosyncratic risk estimated over 1963-2012 can largely or completely explain why IR is low over 2013-2017. The same changes that bring about historically low IR lead to unusually high market-model R-squareds.},

  doi = {10.1137/070710111},
  abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},
